            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In his petitions you'l find his ſoul big with holy affiance, ſpiritual confidence, grounded on Gods word promiſing, and his own Experience taſting.

            <p>And now my Text in its ſituation is not unlike a pleaſant Grove, preſenting to your view variety of pleaſant Trees; each bough thereof being richly laden with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious &amp; goodly fruit, not onely delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the eye, but beneficial to the Taſte: or if you will, your Conceptions may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold moſt coſtly Arras, enriched with the lively ſtory of Gods bounty and mans felicity mutually interwoven in the ſame

            </p>
            <p n="4">4 If God be extreme in puniſhing, man muſt needs be extreme in ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the four ſtreams that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run their diviſion from this pleaſant ſpring, that voluntarily tenders its ſilver drops to refreſh the heart of every pious Chriſtian; which makes me beg your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and zealous attention, whilſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I make theſe glorious truths to paſs before the ſpiritual eye of your intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

            <p>Its the corrupt nature of man to do amiſs.</p>
            <p>As its the nature of man to be doing, ſo its the corruption of that nature to be doing amiſs; and though God ſee and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the actions of diſcompoſed and diſtempered man, yet its onely the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thoſe actions his ſeverity intends to reward with puniſhment: for every action ſimply conſidered in it ſelf is good, and no way meriting unſpeakable torment; but every ſuch action contracts eternal guilt, as performed by and prerſiſted in of ſinful man, whoſe cuſtomary nature and naturall cuſtome is to do evil; for as things are in being ſo they are in operation: <hi>Can a man gather grapes of thornes, or figgs of thiſſles?</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour. Or, <hi>can any man bring a clean thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?</hi> was the queſtion put by holy <hi>Iob.</hi>

Such tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts being likely to lead to no other place but that of darkneſs, yea and that irremedileſs too, without the aſſiſtance of that true light graciouſly promiſed to enlighten every ſoul that cometh into the world; for our nature hath not onely led us from the way of truth, but the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſouls have is onely to find our ſelves involved in miſery and a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of good.

In a word, by all that hath been ſaid, it plainly appears that the ſubject of ſinne is the ſoul, and the body is the inſtrument that ſubject works by; therefore ſinne is ſaid <hi>to reign in our mortal bodies:</hi> ſo then the propoſition is true not onely of them that with <hi>Ahab</hi> ſell themſelves for ſinne; making merchandiſe of that invaluable gemme, which a righteous man would purchaſe with the loſs of life it ſelf (could any thing but the blood of God make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thereof) or them that make a league with ſinne and death; but even the ſaints of God alſo make too true a proof of this aſſertion: Holy <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, is ſometimes found fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the deviſes of his own, though his

            </p>
            <p>And if the task would not procure weariſomneſs to your patience, I might in tracing holy ground, preſent you with variety of examples out of ſacred Writ; <hi>Lot</hi> was no ſooner delivered from devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire, but himſelf preſently burnes in unnatural luſt: <hi>Noah</hi> hath not long eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the floods of waters, but himſelf is drowned in a deluge of wine; and he that was to be the rock upon which Chriſt will build his Church, he himſelf falls from the ſpiritual rock Chriſt Jeſus; and <hi>if this be done in the green tree, what will come of the drie?</hi> that are no ſooner temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but yield, aſſaulted, but embrace it, like the willing bulruſh continually ſink into its nouriſhment the filth and mire of a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſea; ſo that the Pelagians impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant purity, and the Donatiſts unſpotted ſanctity, are but Apochryphal, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be inſerted into the Chriſtians Creed, for we muſt ſay with holy <hi>David,</hi> in the words of my Text, <hi>If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, Lord,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154195:30"/> who can abide it?</hi> And the reaſons of it are cleare.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe not onely our nature alone is found active in evil, but it hath drawn in the will and affections alſo to be its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in ſin; a truth which but now I have preacht to your ears, my whole time for the moſt part hitherto being ſpent in the narration of our corruption both in ſoul and body, of the rebellion of each againſt other, and both againſt God; ſo that if we eye our ſelves as the objects of Gods anger, nothing but everlaſting deſtruction can be expected; the ſoul ſins, and the ſin is conveyed thereunto by the organs of the body, which by a free conſent are joyned in rebellion againſt the Father of lights; whoſe vengeance, if ſevere in reckoning, muſt be expected to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe its eaſier in it ſelf for man to do amiſs than to walk uprightly; for there muſt be the concurrence of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to denominate an action good, whereas the defection and want but of one will make it become evil. Our very conception is in ſin, therefore needs muſt there be facility for us to do amiſs; we need run no further then little infants, who are but our ſelves multiplied, for example in this kind, how much difficulty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is required to work in them one moral action that may beare the name of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154195:31"/> goodneſs? when, on the contrary, great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and much ſeverity can ſcarce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from multiplied acts of evil: Nay, that you may as ſoon bind a wolf with the guts of a tender kid, as ſeek to bridle an impenitent wretch with the cords of love, for by nature we are all King <hi>Solomons</hi> fools, who make it our paſtime to do evil, but to do good have no underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That perfect ſymmetry of righteouſneſs that obtaineth life, if there be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but the obliquity of one act, the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereof will be eternal wrath; ſo ſaith St. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. chap. 10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> Good reaſon then have we to ſtand in awe and ſin not, to watch over our wayes, and be circumſpect: <hi>a little leven will leven the whole lump;</hi> the ſmalleſt ſin unrepented of is able to damne us, and the leaſt law tranſgreſt is ſufficient to procure our damnation, whereas Chriſts infinite merit onely can obtain our ſalvation; <hi>for the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.20. By all which you cannot but underſtand the truth of our aſſertion, namely, its the corrupt nature of man to do amiſs; together with the reaſons thereof.

By all which (as in a chryſtal mirrour) you may clearly ſee the ſad event which continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an impenitent ſtate; Gods mercy affords us ſpace, and leaves us without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but his Juſtice will certainly puniſh us if we repent not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of Judgment; ſhall I call it a mercy to the wicked, that God ſuffers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154195:39"/> them <hi>to treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath?</hi> had it not been a greater mercy rather to have cut them off by ſhortning of their dayes? for by it ſurely ſomething had been ſubſtracted from their torments, which is proportioned to, and meaſured out by their ſins: but that God ſhould in Judgment ſpare them, to proſper in ſin, that they may ſin themſelves finally into perdition, and ſpare them that the ſin may grow as old as the ſinner, that he may go into his grave with bones full of ſinne: though, on the one hand, their length of dayes ſhewes Gods unwearied patience, yet, on the other hand, it gives full proof of their final intolerable miſery. God then is not alwayes extreme in puniſhing of ſinne, and that in reſpect of Judgment to the perſons guilty; he will not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy the <hi>Amorites,</hi> though their ſins come up with a loud cry before him; no, there is a meaſure of ſinne to be filled up as well by Nations as particular perſons, before the decree go forth, and Judgment come upon a Land, to the utter ruine thereof; nay, a Nation may be arrived to the very <hi>Zenith</hi> of Sinne, and yet Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not immediately follow, witneſs <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (and oh that <hi>England</hi> might not be brought in for a teſtimony alſo!

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154195:39"/> ſinnes, in not only ſlaying the Prophets, ſtoning them that preacht repentance unto them, but alſo in killing the Lord of Glory; and yet God ſpared that rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous City forty two years after; which ſhews that God is not alwayes extreme with them that are come to the <hi>Zenith</hi> of ſinne. Oh therefore let <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> ſpace of repentance move us to turn unto the Lord with ſpeed, leſt we alſo periſh in our ſinnes, and there be none to deliver; <hi>For God will make his power known that his name may be declared throughout the earth,</hi> Rom. 9.17. Thus in reſpect of Sinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, of Saints that are converted, and of Reprobates that will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, God is not alwayes extreme to puniſh. And ſo I have done with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond concluſion, and ſhall onely make a little Application thereof to our ſelves, and ſo paſſe to the third obſervable in the Text.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Admire the riches of Gods mercy, that he alwayes puniſhes not according to our ſinnes, and is not alwayes extreme in obſerving when we have ſinned: mercy it was that the Almighty at firſt did make man, who ſtood in no need of the beſt of Creatures, and their moſt pious ſervices; but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154195:40"/> greater mercy, that the Holy One ſhould not utterly deſtroy man when he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that his patience ſhould forbear deſtroying ſinful fleſh; a God of ſo pure a nature that he cannot behold ſinne without hatred, and yet a God of ſo rich mercy, that he ſaves the ſoul when it hath ſinned, proclaiming himſelf to be the Lord, gracious and merciful, paſſing by iniquity, trangreſſion and ſinne: the conſideration whereof made S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord, what am I to thee, that thou ſhouldeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to love thee, and when I love the not thou art angry, ſeeing its miſery enough not to love thee; and when I ſinne and run from thee, yet thou waiteſt ſtill to be gracious to me, and leaveſt no means unattempted that may make me love thee?</hi> And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> I remember hath this expreſſion, <hi>God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is weary of our ſinnes, and is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them as a cart heavy laden with ſheaves; and why doth he not rid himſelf of us who ſinne wilfully in contempt of him, but caſts our ſinnes behind his back, as if no diſhonour were done to his Holy Name by them?</hi> Why doth he thus (ſaith that holy Father, expoſtulating with himſelf) but meerly becauſe he will not be extreme with us? O therefore admire the riches of Gods mercy, who gives you ſpace to repent, and by no means wils your death. Oh I beſeech you then, if you expect that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154195:40"/> God ſhould make your ſouls inceſſantly happy in his eternity, be you holy (<hi>in tua aeternitate,</hi> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) in thy limited and ſhort eternity, that ſo you may come to ſee, not his footſteps or back parts, but his glorious face, by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intuition of his Majeſty: O think with your ſelves how your ſouls ſhall then be filled with glory and happineſs!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O praeclarum &amp; invidendum ſpectaculum!</hi> Oh what a ſea and inundation of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joy muſt needs flow in upon the Soul! and will you not ſtand and admire the riches of that grace which gives you ſpace and means for the obtaining of ſo great a bleſſing?</p>
               <p n="2">2 This may move every one to begin, and, if begun, to increaſe their repentance; the Lord is ready to forgive, and <hi>with thee is mercy</hi> (ſaith the verſe following my Text) <hi>therefore ſhalt thou be feared.</hi> Our ſacrifice and propitiation can be nothing as from our ſelves, its onely Jeſus Chriſt the righteous that can ſatisfie Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended juſtice for our ſinnes; <hi>For if any man ſinne, we have an advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 John 2.1. This is that pearl of great price which hath redeemed us from our Sins, this is the Propitiation with which God is well pleaſed, and is now become, not our angry Judge, but reconciled Father;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154195:41"/> for were he a Judge, and not our Farher, he would be extreme to mark our actions; and were he ſevere, and not mercifull, we could not ſtand before him; <hi>But with thee is mercy that thou maiſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. And in his Beloved he is now made one with us; the partition-wall which ſin had erected, by his ſuffering is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and broken down, that ſo we may now come with boldneſs to the throne of Grace, having an High Prieſt pleading continually for us, and one who knows what it is to bear our ſinnes, and endure our ſorrows. <hi>Therefore let us caſt off the works of darkneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put on the whole armour of light, that ſo we may be able to ſtand in the evil day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But withall, let us take heed of taking occaſion to live in ſinne becauſe God is merciful, and becauſe he is gracious, to turn that grace which ſhould ſave us into wantonneſs; this is to treaſure up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath, and to lay upon our ſelves a mark of reprobation: for though it be true of our God what <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadads</hi> ſervants ſaid of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael, we have heard that they are merciful Kings;</hi> ſo you may ſay, if we ſin, yet our God is merciful to forgive; and ſo ſinne, that grace may abound: do not thus deceive your ſouls; for the ſame God that is a merciful Father to true Penitents, is alſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154195:41"/> a jealous Lord over wretched ſinners, and will, like <hi>Iehu,</hi> drive on his Judgments furiouſly againſt rebellious ſinners, and will wound the hairy ſcalp of all Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. Behold therefore the goodneſs, and the ſeverity of God; ſeverity to them that go on in ſinne impenitently, but goodneſs to them which truly repent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. Oh therefore let me perſwade you whoſe ſouls as yet ſit in darkneſs, and in a ſtate of ſinne, to awaken your ſelves out of this woful ſecurity; conſider, if thou turn to the Lord with all thy heart, and truly art ſorry for thy ſinnes, conſider I ſay, he is ready to forgive, and waits that he may be gracious to thy immortal Soul for which Chriſt dyed: but on the other hand, if thou continue in ſinne, know aſſuredly, thou vile impenitent, he will come in flames of fire, to revenge himſelf upon thy implacable and immalleable heart: Oh therefore, while its called to day, harden not your ſelves againſt his fear, but get your peace made with him ere it be too late: and you that have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, do you perſevere unto the end, that ſo you may receive that crown of Life which ſhall never be taken from you, for he will not alwayes be extreme with you; and yet ſevere with thoſe that continue in ſinne, becauſe when he pleaſes, he can be extreme to mark what is done amiſs:

               <p n="1">1. To remove that grand idol which men make, and ſet up in their own hearts, that God is all mercy, and will not puniſh, or all love, and cannot endure to afflict his people: deceive not your ſelves with ſuch vain deluſions, for <hi>the ſoul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that ſoul ſhall ſurely die,</hi> Ezek. 18.4.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To remove the Atheiſm that lodges in mens hearts, of no revenging Juſtice;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154195:44"/> that men live and ſpeak as if there was no God, uttering that in words and actions which holy <hi>Davids</hi> fool entertained in his heart; that men being to think there is no God, becauſe they ſee no fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his Juſtice ſet before them in the deſtruction of his enemies; that the wickeds proſperity in evil makes him boaſt himſelf, and deſpiſe his Maker. I remember Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in the proud man, ſpeaking thus; when he was at peace, and no diſturbance injured him, ſaith he of himſelf, <hi>if I had nothing worth deſpiſing I ſhould be a God;</hi> blaſphemouſly imagining God were ignorant of that which men call contempt: but faith the Father, <hi>It was not long ere I ſaw the ſame wretch caſt down with utter amazement by a ſmall clap of thunder:</hi> when God did but ſeem to clothe himſelf with the garment of vengeance, he preſently fell down with humble obeiſance. Therefore God will ſometimes be extreme in puniſhing, that he may reſcue the glory of his juſtice out of the hands of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Such is the nature of ſinne, it juſtly provokes God to be extreme, becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1 Its a tranſgreſſion of his righteous law; and if earthly Monarchs puniſh their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels with temporal, well may the Lord of Heaven and earth reward his traitors with eternal death; if temporal magiſtrates are

               <p n="2">2 Every ſin is not onely a tranſgreſſion of Gods law, but its an injury offered to his ſacred perſon; there being no act of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wherein our whole man deliberately concurs, but it is as much as in us lyes to dethrone the Majeſty of heaven, and if it lay in our power alſo, to ungod the ſacred Trinity; an action which my ſoul trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to think of, much more to utter; and were it not that I might leave the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof ſo deep as to imbitter ſinne unto you, I ſhould not have named it.</p>
               <p>But that's not all, for</p>
               <p n="3">3 Every ſin is ſo much the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is committed by perſons that have received all ſorts of kindneſs, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all manner of obligations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; therefore well may God be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme for ſin, when found in them that are engaged to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Such is the nature of Gods juſtice that it requires exact and equal proportion of puniſhment to the ſinnes that have been committed; now every ſinne is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite duration, for did the ſinner alwayes live, he would for ever be guilty of ſinne;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154195:45"/> therefore it is but juſt the puniſhment ſhould be infinite alſo; for if God reward us with glory (if we ſerve him) above our deſerts, can we condemn him for but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding us according to our faults? and if he do ſpare us, and not inflict the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his juſtice, it is becauſe his mercy intercedes, that glorious attribute wherein is his chief delight: but God will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be extreme to puniſh, becauſe the nature of his juſtice is ſuch as that it will proportion its puniſhment to our deſerts, and that with ſpeed too; <hi>for the time draws neer, when God will come to judge the earth righteouſly, and the nations with his truth, Pſal.</hi> 96.13.

Oh ſit down then, and hang your mournful harps upon the willows of contrition, caſt away from you all terrene hopes of comfort, which at laſt, like <hi>Egypts</hi> reeds, will prove no further uſeful, then with ſorrow to pierce your troubled ſides; lean no longer upon the ſtaffe of your own underſtanding, leſt your falling thence become irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but betake your ſelves with true and pure devotion to that golden mercy-ſeat, whence none ever returned empty that ſought aright; for there is no armour able to reſiſt or divert Gods ſevere judgements but pious prayers and fervent ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and no doubt but if you thus do, but he who lends an ear to the cry of ſpeechleſs blood, will not turne it away from the voice of your petitions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if put up in the name of him, whoſe employment it is to propitiate for the ſins of the whole world; you muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your ſelves ſinners, and if living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, you may be ſure the end thereof will be eternal miſery; Therefore its eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans great concernment, as he would
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154195:46"/> eſcape the laſt, to provide againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and the ſooner the better, becauſe we know not how ſoon our accounts will be demanded, and God come with, <hi>ah thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore to day while its called to day let's hear his voice, and not harden our hearts againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Seeing none can ſay his heart is clean, and all have reaſon to ſay, every one is more righteous then we; Oh then what fountains of tears ſhould we ſhed, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to bath our ſinful ſouls in, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize our ſelves anew in penitential teares! not that the water alone hath any clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing virtue in it, (for the very ſprings muſt be purged by the rock Jeſus Chriſt) yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is ofttimes an inſeparable ſigne of being cleanſed; for when ſins by us are truly repented of, Gods favourable eye of compaſſion looks on thoſe ſins as if they were never committed; and where our ſins look <hi>as red as crimſon,</hi> we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have our tears <hi>as white as ſnow,</hi> that falling ſincerely from the eye of a true penitentiary they prevail with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies to paſs over our ſouls when his judgements begin to be executed; ſo then we muſt put off the redneſs of guilt, that ſo we may be clothed with the white robe of innocency, by getting our ſins and iniquities blotted out. But do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154195:46"/> your ſelves, it is not a ſeeming holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or appearing innocency, acquired by our own ſtrength, that will avail us; ſuch weak lights are eaſily blown out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct by the guſt of every temptation; or like the coſtly gilt of a well-tuned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, appearing pleaſant while ſuch, but when once the ſtrings begin to jar, the impatient hand with fury caſts both them and all its beauty from it, as if no ſuch lovelineſs had ever there been found. Therefore above all things tis our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to make ſure work in the things of eternity, not taking them upon truſt, or others credit, but our own experience, not fearing others ſo much as our own eternall weal; for there is nothing hath been ſo much the bane of Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as an overweening conceit of our own ſanctity, ſaluting every man with a Phariſaical <hi>Stand off, I am more holy then thou,</hi> diſdaining to think any are ſo high in Chriſts eſteem as our ſelves; whereas our trueſt glorying is onely in the croſs of Chriſt, and an humble heart, <hi>which in the ſight of God is of great price: For if thou Lord be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, who can abide it?</hi> And this brings me to the ſecond obſervation propounded, namely,</p>
               <p>That the mercy of God is ſuch, he'l not alwaies be extreme to mark whats done amiſs.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:154195:47"/>
               <p>Mercy is Gods proper work, it is that wherein his chief delight doth reſt: what was reported of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Emperour, and left upon record for his eternal fame, <hi>viz.</hi> that he wept when he came to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his name to condemne a man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loth to dip his finger in the blood of his fellow-creature; is much more true of the Father of Mercy: witneſs thoſe tears that dropt from the eyes of our Saviour over impenitent <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> a ſad preſage of approching ruine, and yet a true ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of his unwillingneſs to put the ſame in execution, though they were already come to the <hi>Zenith</hi> of impiety, killing the King of Glory, and the Saviour of the world; and though but beholding this at a diſtance, ſuch was his mercy that it made him weep.</p>
               <p>Mercy is an attribute that of it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to God; juſtice is as it were by accident, becauſe of mans evil; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he ſaid to wait to do the one, but ſparing in execution of the other; yea he is unwilling to execute determined wrath; therefore he ſaith, <hi>how ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim?</hi> and, <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 11.8, 9. therefore, <hi>he that hateth nothing that he hath made,</hi> will not alwaies be extreme with what he hath not made, leſt with it he deſtroy the work of his hands: for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:154195:47"/> of God is exerciſed towards man as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a twofold capacity.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As a ſinner.</item>
                  <item>2. As his creature.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. As a ſinner; that he may <hi>do away his ſins,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. he makes open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation thereof; <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins:</hi> ſo willing is God to free the ſinner from miſtaking the perſon, that he ingeminates the word, as if he had ſaid, if thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted who it is that muſt do away thy ſins, know that it is I, I, who am thy maker, and put thee in a bleſſed condition whence thou fell; and it is I who again will reſtore thee and ſend a pardon in the name of my Son and thy Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Mercy is exerciſed about him as his creature, to receive him into favour, not to puniſh him above meaſure, though he be out of meaſure ſinful: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.9. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none elſe, I am God, and there is none like me.</hi> That God puniſhes ſinful man, is the act of his juſtice; that he is not ſevere in puniſhing, is an act of his mercy; yea ſo loth he is to be cruel, that he would have his creatures put him in mind of his mercy, as if nothing ſo much delighted him as to have his ſervants to think and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be merciful; for ſo you read,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154195:48"/> 
                  <hi>Put me in remembrance, let us plead together, declare thou that thou maieſt be juſtified,</hi> Iſa. 43.29. wherein he that runs may read this ſacred truth, that God is not alwaies extreme to mark what is done amiſs, but is full of compaſſion. And this he doth</p>
               <p n="1">1. For his names ſake, which in holy <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtile is no other then <hi>the Lord, the Lord, God merciful and gracious, long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> Exod. 34.6. And that the power of this glorious name may never fall, nor the remembrance thereof fail in the hearts of the ſons of men, he will ſtill go on to make his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful name in much glory, in much majeſty to paſs before them; <hi>for all the waies of the Lord are mercy and truth,</hi> Pſ. 26.10. <hi>For though many ſorrowes ſhall be to the wicked, yet he that truſteth in the Lord mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall compaſs him about.</hi> Pſ. 32.10. <hi>He is onely the God that heareth,</hi> and can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>prayer, therefore to him muſt all fleſh come:</hi> it is his glorious name alone which is as an oyntment poured out, the excellency of whoſe favour perfumes the hearts of all that love him; <hi>whoſe very goings rejoyce the morning and evening ſeaſons.</hi> Other names and titles may give us free paſſage among the ſons of men, and get or loſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but it is onely the name <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:154195:48"/> who is mighty to ſave, that can give us a name to live when dead in ſin; whoſe goodneſs crownes not onely the years,<note place="margin">Pſ. 60.11.</note> but the hearts of his people with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory. And ſo I paſs to the ſecond ground of mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his natures ſake, whoſe very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to have mercy; therefore when God in mercy ſpares his people from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited wrath, he compares himſelf to a father, vailing his compaſſion under that tender relation; but when juſtice can no longer ſpare but by being injurious to its honour, by the provocation of our ſins calling for vengeance to be poured upon our perſons, then he repreſents himſelf <hi>like a woman big with pain, and travailing</hi> with grief (if I may ſo ſpeak) to bring forth that juſt ire he hath been long in conceiving.</p>
               <p>Yea mercy appears and is ſeen in hell it ſelf, becauſe though he puniſh to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of time, yet not to a fulneſs of horror, in intenſion of torment; whereas juſtice, like the harlots, will have the ſinner divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſoul from body, to be different ſharers in eternal miſery. Let thy lawes (O Lord) be writ in bloody characters upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners head, is juſtices language, that ſo he may eternally <hi>wound the hairy ſcalp of him that hath wilfully gone aſtray:</hi> but mercy, like the true mother, continually cries,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154195:49"/> ſpare the child (Lord) and ſave the ſinner from eternal woe; and at length this mournful voice proves effectual in the ears of Heaven, and with <hi>Iacob,</hi> obtaines the bleſſing; for indeed mercy is the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our lives, which elſe had long ſince been a ſacrifice for our ſins, had not the <hi>ſcape-goat carried them away into the land of forgetfulneſs,</hi> and by becoming a victime for the ſame, buried all our tranſgreſſions in his grave, that ſo they may never be able to riſe in judgement, either againſt our perſons or our ſervices; whoſe very nature it is to become an advocate for rebells, and like an affectionate ſurety pay the debt, that ſo the debtor may go free: and this he doth, not for our righteouſneſs, or any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is to be found in us or our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but for his name and natures ſake. And ſo I paſs to the third ground of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, namely</p>
               <p n="3">3. For his glories ſake.</p>
               <p>For his glory,

                     </gap>to thee O thou preſerver of men? why haſt thou ſet me as a mark againſt thee?</hi> &amp;c. Once for all, take it in the 14. chap. 2. verſ. and ſo on, <hi>Man cometh out like a flower, and is cut down, he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not; and doeſt thou open thine eyes upon ſuch an one, and bringeſt me into judgement with thee? as a leaf alſo is he blown away with every wind:</hi> ſo is our ſoul toſſed with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temptations, ſometimes with the eaſt wind of preſumption, on the contrary, with the weſt of deſpair; now hurried with the north of rage, by and by carried away with the ſouthwind of luſt: thus like a tennis-ball is poor man racketed from one temptation to another, till at laſt he hazard eternal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; reeling from one extreme to another untill he fall into perpetual miſery.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude, let me implore every ſoul that expects and looks for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, (as who doth not?) to get clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all your iniquities, whether ſecret or open, latent or revealed, before you come unto the brink of miſery from whence is no return; before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains wherein is no ſecurity: let no iniquity ever have any more dominion over you, get all your actions ſalted with true grace, that God

For the woman, ſhe was a virgin, but what, a virgin to bear, to bring forth a ſon? a wonder; and ſhe her ſelf cryes out, <hi>I know not a man;</hi> well might the Prophet <hi>Ierem.</hi> ſay, <hi>Behold</hi> a <hi>Virgin:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> likewiſe, yet ſhe is the ſame, <hi>Iſa.</hi> the 7.14. verſ. but that Chriſt <hi>was conceived of the holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> is an article of our faith, not of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; beſt known is the manner to him that hath the power; virgins are not uſually pregnant, yet the ſpirit ingenders fleſh, we take it not from his nature but power; the Holy Ghoſt produces the man Chriſt not of himſelf, but by his power: Chriſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of himſelf as one with the Father, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him on the great errand of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for all the three Perſons in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity have a ſhare in this great work, the Father begetting, the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and the Holy Ghoſt produced him at the fulneſs of time: I call the Holy Ghoſt Father, as his ſhadow; the virgin his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154195:53"/> mother as his ſubſtance, or the matter of his perſon, whereby he is called the ſon of man, that by this means he might be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our nature, and ſo become ſurety for us: as for example, we chriſtians <hi>are born of water &amp; of the ſpirit,</hi> &amp; are not called the ſons of water, but of the ſpirit, becauſe of the ſpirit we are made one with Chriſt, and are thereby become the ſons of God, that Chriſt was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt and of <hi>Mary</hi> is moſt certain, but for our ſakes called the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> and not of the Holy Ghoſt, yet hath the ſon an equality with the ſpirit, and is perfect God as well as man, therefore is it that the Holy Ghoſt concurs with <hi>Mary</hi> in the conception, both agree to make Chriſt, but not one way; for tis his the ſhadow, hers the ſubſtance; hers the carkaſe, his the quinteſſence: how could it be but a <hi>holy thing,</hi> being of the Holy Ghoſt? though ſhe had ſin, yet Chriſt took none from her, becauſe he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it from her; for had Chriſt been born of an Harlot, of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> yet ſhe could not have contaminated his integrity, but commended his power and mercy; he could have ſanctified the moſt ſinful perſon and unhallowed womb.</p>
            <p>Being conceived of the holy Ghoſt, he took our fleſh, but not our corruption; can the ſun ſhine untainted on the dunghil?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154195:53"/> much more can the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> appear in our clay without contagion; can we ſuſpect a deity to receive a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from humanity? <hi>for he was born of a Virgin, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though a Virgin, yet eſpouſed to a man, that Chriſt might be <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſuppoſed ſon,<note place="margin">Eſa. 7.19.</note> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> be Chriſts ſuppoſed father; he choſe one that was a Virgin, that the Jewes might ſee their propheſie fulfilled in him, the true Meſſiah; and that they ſhould not ſuppoſe him the ſon of an Harlot, he was born of an eſpouſed virgin, that marriage might be honourable to all;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.2.</note> 
               <hi>for a virgin ſhall conceive &amp;c.</hi> And thus, the Church bears us as chaſt virgins to Chriſt the eſpouſed head. There was no need of the Elders of the City to judge of her purity, for ſhe was no Harlot, but one under eſpouſals,<note place="margin">22. Deut. 15.</note> and yet not a wife, but a virgin, <hi>for as yet ſhe had not known man,</hi> St. Luk. 1.34. <hi>Mary</hi> brought forth Chriſt, <hi>for ſhe brought forth;</hi> which brings me to the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The birth, <hi>ſhe brought forth;</hi> when the fulneſs of time was brought to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, he that made time was in time, he that created the world came into the world, he that brought forth his mother was born of his mother: the Angels won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the incarnation, every good ſpirit groans to ſee this glorious wonder brought forth; now or never <hi>truth flouriſhes out of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154195:54"/> the earth, and righteouſneſs out of the womb of the mother:</hi> he that ſtept from heaven into the womb, ſtept into the earth out of the womb; he that at the firſt creation made man without a mother would not now make God-man without a mother; the Creator makes uſe ſometimes of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to produce his omnipotency, and who cannot admire ſuch purity, virginity, in ſuch pregnancy? that the fruit of her body ſhould ripen, and yet a virgin, a maiden bringing forth what was not begotten, but made, and yet not created, but begotten; well might it be a virgin in whom it was made, and a God by whom it was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Add to this, that the begetting not the birth diſhonours the party among men, whoſe conceptions are in ſin; but here the begetting brings honour to the party both in the conception and birth, becauſe begotten from above: the fleſh of man is not of man, but of the mother, and the fleſh of Chriſt God-man, is not of man, but a virgin, that none ſhould diſpute his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and yet begotten not by man, but of the Spirit, that none might queſtion his Deity. Therefore let us not diſpute how begotten of a virgin, conſidering his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for I cannot believe him man without a mother, and I cannot believe him God if I do not believe his virgin-mother. The virgin did breed by her own, but unuſual
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154195:54"/> way of conception; if we believe not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begets him without the help of the wife, we ſhall not believe he was born of a mother without the help of a husband; <hi>ſhe was a virgin, and brought forth her firſt-born ſon,</hi> which brings me to the third particular.</p>

O the vanity of men much more of Chriſtians! Chriſt took our

Neceſſity of clothes ſpeaks us men and the decency of them ſpeaks us Chriſtians; Chriſt was wrapt in ſwadling-clothes, and laid in a manger. And ſo I come to the Childs poverty, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>God brought forth man like a King, and placed him in Paradiſe, but he brought forth God-man like a beaſt, in a ſtable, and laid him in a manger; Chriſt was abaſed as to a beaſt, left all honour as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he might reſtore them to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wiſdome who by ſinne were become like the beaſts that periſh. Chriſt came to reſtore man, and therefore would become one with the loweſt of men, that none might come ſhort of ſalvation. O ſilly creature, know thy maſter, the Lord of honour is now
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154195:58"/> companion of beaſts; obey him then in his humiliation, that hath diſobeyed him in his glory; what can we behold in this his abridgment, but the contemning of the pride and the glory of the world in his ſanctified humility? why ſhould Chriſt be thus low and mean, but to teach us to prize nothing but heavenly things?</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154195:71"/> in Chriſt, and you ſee him ſecure, he is happy though that hope may be croſt; for here is the comfort that a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath hope in Chriſt not in this life onely, and that in two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. The leſſe proper place for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the act of Hope.</item>
                  <item>2. The more principle Object of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The leſſe proper place for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the act of Hope; for when the Soul departing from the Body ſhall come to her country, and be poſſeſſed of the fruition of God, which ſhe panted after, ſhe in her ſelf doth not hope, becauſe the things hoped for are preſent, and becauſe of the ſpecial union of the Soul with Chriſt, yet ſtill there is hope in Heaven, for the full manifeſtation of the promiſes: <hi>For the Souls under the Altar cry, how long Lord, holy and true? &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 6.9, 10. But that which the Souls in Heaven have ſimply, and in regard of the happineſs they enjoy is not hope, <hi>for hope that is ſeen is not hope;</hi> for there it is not faith but viſion, and not hope, but fruition; yet in ſome ſenſe, they wait for the accompliſhment of all the Divine promiſes: for the difference lies in theſe reſpects following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That above it differs from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in degrees of Excellency; that here below is grounded on Faith, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the promiſes of God darkly, but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154195:72"/> that above is grounded on a clear ſight, and a perfect viſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hope below is attended with ſighs and ſadneſſes, that above without ſorrow, all ſighing and ſorrow being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their hearts, whoſe tears are wiped away with the light of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This below hath weakneſſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, but that above is a confirmed hope, thus our hope, even to the day of Judgement ſhall not be aboliſhed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in regard of Eſſence it remains, but in regard of weakneſſes, it ceaſes. For till Gods promiſes be accompliſhed there, is yet hope in exerciſing that act, that may bring us to the enjoyment of the higheſt manifeſtation of Divine Love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The more principall objects, not in this life onely, that is not onely for the things of this life, but the things of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life; for though hope looking to God, it refers to the things of this life for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, yet it chiefly reſpects the things of the other life, the reſurrection of the fleſh, &amp;c. other hopes may promiſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but will but ſerve as figge leaves; other hopes may bring to the fruition of what we hope for, but cannot give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but ſuch is the excellency of this hope, as it will ſupply ſo much as faith can beleeve, or hope deſire: ſo that, as it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154195:72"/> would be deſperateneſs to caſt away this anchor, ſo again madneſs to caſt it off as needleſs: the Saints which ſhould be climbing Heaven, it would be folly for them to ply this hope about this life, when we may have it about a better; to hope in this life onely is unchriſtian, and leſſe then Chriſtianity will not give us the hope of an eternal life: to follow Chriſt onely to get poſſeſſion of outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, is but to ſtarve our ſouls while we feed our bodies with the loaves of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sanctity; for he that will be Heir to Chriſts Kingdome, muſt expect to be crown'd with thornes, temporal felicity ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no entailment upon his diſcipleſhip, perſecution being their portion, and their ſufferings part of their triumph. So that each true Beleever muſt joyn in the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, with the ſong of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſt in the words of my Text:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi>

It is true, Chriſt had the Title of a King, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, nor himſelf made any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Lawes; and though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not himſelf to be a King, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to dethrone <hi>Caeſar;</hi> for he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>my Kingdome is not of this world:</hi> So then, you ſee he is not in oppoſition to the Kings of the earth, he came not to take away earthly Kingdomes, but to give
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154195:74"/> an Heavenly Kingdome; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Give to Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt obey the temporal Lord for his ſake who is the Heavenly Lord, for they who yeild not obedience to temporal Kings for Chriſts ſake, (who hath commanded it) have as yet made no glorious entrance into the Kingdome of Heaven; for love to Chriſt, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Caeſar</hi> may and do dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The words look upon mens works as they are Chriſtians, who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of lawful Superiours with their ſwords in their hands, had rather die fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then betray their liberty by a cowardly reſignation of their lives and fortunes; and alſo as Chriſtians they have learnt of Chriſt their Head, to pay Tribute where lawfully it is demanded; for if any might have rebelled, and refuſed the ſame, none more lawful and able then our Saviour, who could at his pleaſure <hi>command more then twelve legions of Angels</hi> to aſſiſt him, and could command all the treaſures of the earth as King and Lord thereof; yet refuſed the glory of the one to pay lawful tribute, and the innumerable force of the other, that with ſilence he might anſwer <hi>Caeſars</hi> Deputy, <hi>for he came to bear witneſs of the truth;</hi> and he will rather loſe his life then his obedience.</p>

Chriſt Jeſus, the Captain of our Salvation hath led us the way; for when all conſpired againſt him becauſe he ſpake the truth, yet was he with his life ready to juſtifie the truth, ſaying, <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The lives of moſt men are miſpent only for want of a certain end to run at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhoot their arrowes, and know not at what mark they levell, and direct their proceeding by they know not what rule; therefore it is that they reach not to perfection, and end not in comfort. Some levell at the right end, but levell amiſs: To levell without an end were folly, to a falſe end, were loſſe; true Chriſtians onely finde the right way, for a wiſe Chriſtian amidſt the many changes of this mortal life, ſtill preſſes on to one ſteddy end by holy endeavours; for the more he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken in his reſolutions, the nearer he cometh to the great exemplar of life, Chriſt Jeſus, who ſtood firm unto the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154195:76"/> end, and continued ſtedfaſt in the truth, witneſſing the ſame with the loſſe of his moſt precious life, as himſelf affirmes, <hi>To this end was I borne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be both needleſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for me to undertake the calculation of our Saviours Nativity, or to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery unto you of thoſe ſignes which did accompany it in a moſt miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or to tell you the wonderful effects thereof ſet down in the Goſpel; which though they were above the ordinary courſe of nature, yet you muſt know, that thoſe Celeſtial conſtellations did not contribute any thing to the producing of that glorious Birth, but only in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unuſual manner were made to bear witneſs unto this great truth that is in my Text ſaid to be born, that he alſo may give teſtimony to the truth. Indeed there is a no leſſe impious then fooliſh Proverb taken up by men in the world, upon the event of any action or thing, to lay the cauſe thereof upon the Stars and Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary influencies; and thereby men think, when guilty, to excuſe themſelves, ſaying, a fatal neceſſity brought it upon me, or they were compelled to it, ſaying irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, I was born to this, or the Stars deſigned me to it; as if ſome extrinſecal neceſſity did draw men to ſinne, as if the Stars were the cauſes of mens iniquity;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154195:76"/> yet of the two thoſe are better (though juſtly to be condemned alſo) that would excuſe themſelves by laying the fault upon the influence of malignant Planets, or their own corrupt nature, then thoſe that inferre the cauſe from a neceſſity in the peremptory decree of Almighty God, as if Holineſs it ſelf ſhould take pleaſure in making men criminal. Such a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imbibed, is enough to bring a man to that opinion of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> at leaſt; if not to think that there is a good and an evil God, yet that the one Almighty Eſſence acts as if he were divided, by ſaying, though God would have men otherwiſe then they are, yet he hath decreed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain end of miſery to the greateſt part of men, without any reſpect of good or evil in their perſons; and ſo make the evil actions of men determined by Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: and what will this come ſhort of them that attribute the good actions of men to a good God, and their evil actions to an evil God? Yet thoſe <hi>Stoicks</hi> that make two Gods, and theſe Planetiſts that lay the fault of their actions upon the Stars, are much better then thoſe that ſay all things are abſolutely neceſſary, and that all their ends are undeterminable by any actions of men whether good or evil; it will be better to raiſe the evil accidents from an evil then from a good God.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154195:77"/> But that we are under a fatal decree of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as to event, or that we were born to commit this or the other evil, we utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny; and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, by conſidering the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that will follow upon aſſerting a peremptory decree; for if Gods peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory decree hath deſigned ſin to come into the world, then men ſinne not in deed, but in opinion onely; neceſſity hath no law, and where neceſſity bears ſway, there the will hath no power, and ſo man becomes equal with the beaſts of the field, with the Lion, whoſe unbridled appetite cannot be reſtrained by the rigor of the ſevereſt law; and the reaſon is, becauſe they cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admonition do otherwiſe, they cannot uſe principles of reaſon; and therefore is it that mad men and children are under no law, becauſe not capable of rational acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for no man is commanded to do thoſe things neceſſity requires; as for example, no man is bidden to eat, drink, and ſleep, becauſe theſe actions, and affections are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of life; the will may govern, but not ſuppreſs them: indeed charity is of neceſſity; whether it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a free principle within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or without; and we are careleſs of thoſe things that are without, if neceſſity have no law; for if acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in themſelvs have no law, then they are not ſinful, for where no tranſgreſſion of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154195:77"/> law is, there can be no ſin, &amp; if all things be ruled by deſtiny, then they are of neceſſity, and ſo by conſequence our actions are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad in themſelves, but onely are good or evil, as eſteemed by us, and in our opinion; and if it be ſo, then to what purpoſe was the Son of God made man, and ſo became a ſacrifice for ſin? to what end are exhortations, and means uſed to hinder men from ſin, if they are but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? a Chriſtians calling and Chriſts dying are meer fables, if ſin be not ſin; if ſin be nothing, it matters not, let men live how they liſt; and whither tends this principle, but to the ſubverſion of all religion? when a man layes the ground of all his actions upon the peremptory decree of Almighty God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, this belief clearely takes away a mans conſcience; for why ſhould men ſtrive to hinder ſin, or make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what they do, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there is a neceſſity of ſinning lies upon them? and why ſhould a man weep and mourn for that evil for which there is a neceſſity he do commit it? as it muſt needs be, when a mans ſins are his deſtiny, and not any thing in himſelf the cauſe thereof: therefore if it be ſo, if ſin be not at all ours, but of deſtiny, or upon an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable decree, then all our teares and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are ſpent in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when once
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154195:78"/> this principle is throughly entertained, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot long continue, therefore how cautious ſhould we be of harbouring ſuch principles? much better were it for us to reflect upon our ſelves as the onely cauſe and inſtruments of ſin; and be alwaies afraid leſt Gods juſt puniſhments ſhould unavoidably overtake our evil actions; and in this moderate ſenſe feare makes a man apprehenſive of a Deity, alwaies unwilling to offend him, and ever careful to keep a good conſcience, which the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will lead a man to deſtroy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It takes away the guilt of ſin; for whatſoever is fatal, cannot be juſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, becauſe thoſe ſins for which men are juſtly rewarded with puniſhment, muſt be concluded to have been within their power to have avoided them; but fatal actions are not ſo, neither can any man be temporally or eternally puniſhed for thoſe actions which he was born to commit; for for a temporary offence which a man could no way avoid, no eternal puniſhment can juſtly be inflicted, the imbecillity of his power juſtly reprieving him from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation; and as no eternal, ſo no temporary judgement can belong unto them, for if magiſtrates thought mens offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unavoidable, they would think it boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to puniſh them; but we ſee Judges puniſh men for offences, becauſe they know men
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154195:78"/> have a power to refrain from breaking the law, having dayly experience, that fear of puniſhment hath kept men inoffenſive: but on the other ſide, if the offender ſhould think the offence for which he ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to have been his deſtiny, whether it be murder, rebellion or acts of treaſon, and other villanies, &amp;c. and that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the neceſſity of a decree, and that to this end he was born, then he would and might very well plead innocency, and complain he was unjuſtly puniſhed for that which he had no power to refuſe, ſo that you ſee ſuch a principle as this, will be the diſſolution of all government both tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual; for how can it ſtand with the juſtice of God to puniſh man, yea to deſtroy to eternity both ſoul and body, for the breaking of that law which he never had power to keep? nay more, to puniſh him for that evil which he could not avoid; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his peremptory decree from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had reprobated him unto it: and if this be true, that tribunal would not be juſt, where the ſentence of everlaſting fire ſhall be pronounced againſt a man for that very action in which he was meerly paſſive, having no power to avoid it; this were to make God unjuſt in his proceedings with mankind, for the recompence of good or evil cannot be given to good or evil, that are ſo, not freely, but of neceſſity, for where neceſſity is, there is no place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154195:79"/> And therefore how vain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are we in our thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when we place mens Nativities under fatal conſtellations, or their actions under a peremptory decree, when as God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men liberty to live freely under his righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous judgments? It were injuſtice in God to puniſh ſuch that he had firſt made ſuch; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a point of ignorance &amp; madneſs for any that believe the reſurrection of the dead, and the day of judgement, where God will render to all according to their works, for him to ſay, that there is a deſtiny lyes upon their actions; for how can true faith and piety ſtand to this monſtrous aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this were ſo, then all the whole life of man would be but a deſtiny, all our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations would be deſtiny, and all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral changes and events that fall out in a nation or kingdome would be but by chance, and a kind of fatal neceſſity, if there were truth in this opinion, and ſo we ſhould do juſt nothing; for if it be Gods decree to purpoſe ſin within; and an extrinſecal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity rule us without; to what purpoſe were preaching and hearing if men be not capable of exhortation? all ſuch means are in vain, and will never convert a ſinner: or to what end is duty preſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and men called upon to repent, to get grace, to be meek and humble? yea why are there promiſes made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154195:79"/> in Chriſt Jeſus through believing that we may obtain remiſſion of ſins, if that be a truth, which ſome affirme, that the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory decree of Almighty God rules all, and that to this or that end men were born? And if lawes do nothing, wherefore were they made? wherefore were Ordinances preſcribed, if they contribute nothing to help us heaven-ward? and why is it that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters accommodate themſelves by meet words, fit to work on mens underſtandings and affections, and with the reaſonableneſs of Chriſtian religion labour to captivate their wills, to bring them under obedience, if by a peremptory decree, which is unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they are deſigned to another end? wherefore are the promiſes of mercy, and the threats of eternal judgement made uſe of, if there be no power in man that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of perſwaſion, and that will admit of a change from evil to good? I am ſure ſuch a tenent is none of the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick Church, for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces them accurſed that ſay any man is predeſtinated to ſin; and we do pronounce ſuch accurſed, if any ſuch there be; and many there are amongſt us that ſay all events are from neceſſity: ſo that by this time you cannot but ſee how irrational and unchriſtian it is for a man to lay the cauſe of all his actions upon Gods peremptory decree. And ſo I have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154195:80"/> done with that error, and come now to the other opinion, which will have all actions regulated by the influence of ſtars.</p>
            <p>And here ſecondly, we utterly deny that any action is brought about or neceſſitated by the influence of ſtars, or in reſpect of any fatal conſtellation; for though it be true, that there are infinite of heavenly bodies, conformable to the inferiour creatures, and that there are ſome particular planets, which have ſpecial influence upon, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over ſome particular climates over which they are placed, and therefore it is that we read of the <hi>ſweet influences of Pleiades, and of Mazzoroth in his ſeaſon,</hi> Job 38.31. <hi>and the whole heavens ſhall hear the earth,</hi> Hoſea 2.21. ſo that we ſee there is a correſpondence held between the ſtars above, and the creatures below the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though ſome are deſtructive in their courſes, and fight againſt their enemies; thus <hi>the ſtars in their courſes are ſaid to fight againſt Siſera,</hi> Judg. 5.20. and hence it is ſaid, there is a heavenly veſſel that emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it ſelf into the lower veſſel, and that every herb diſcovers it ſelf to be uſeful for this or that part of mans body, by the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude which it carries unto that part for which it is medicinal; and that every one hath governing from its proper ſtar, that every thing living hath a ſtarry influence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154195:80"/> upon it, and that there is not a man, beaſt, or ſtone, but hath influence from the ſtars: now granting all this to be a truth (as it is the opinion of ſome) yet it will be ſtill found an infallible aſſertion, that though all the ſtars at once were malignant, they could not force any man to ſin, their malevolous aſpects cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel any man to commit iniquity: indeed by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> our nature was corrupted, and ſo the creature became ſubject unto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet as we recover our ſelves from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> they loſe that power of vanity, and ſo by conſequence no extrinſecal meanes can be the cauſe of ſin in reſpect of a fatal conſtellation: but to ſay we were born during the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of ſuch or ſuch a Plannet, and our guidance in the way to eternal life is from God alone is a moſt certain truth; for the ſun and Moon which are the great lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of heaven and earth, can do no more by their power towards our good or evil eſtate, then a lame man can help himſelf to walk that hath no legs; nay the Angels in Heaven can do no more then wiſh and long for the proſperity of Gods choſen. Therefore how much of vanity is there in thoſe minds who impute that power to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial creatures, which God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they ſhould poſſeſs? for take them at the beſt, and they are but ſuch inſtruments
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:154195:81"/> as can doe nothing without him, <hi>that doth whatſoever he will both in Heaven and in Earth, the Sea and all deep places.</hi> We muſt not when we doe that which is evil lay the charge upon God, or the Stars, or the Angels, who are the inſtruments that act thoſe Stars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt not lay the blame on God; <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted he is tempted of God, &amp;c.</hi> St. James 13.13. No, <hi>let no man ſay he hath cauſed me to erre, or that it is through the Lord that I fell away, for he hath no need of the ſonne of man</hi> ſaith the ſon of <hi>Syrach, Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 15.11, 12. For the Lord hateth all abomination; ſo contrary is ſinne unto his Holineſſe, that his eyes are upon them that fear him; and they that truly love God, will do his will, and obey his Commandements; for they know that Gods Juſtice hath no need to advance its glory by the deſtruction of their lives. Nor</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can any man juſtly impute his ſinnes to the holy Angels; for it is the property of them to hearken to the voice of God, and alwayes to be doing of that which is good: <hi>O praiſe the Lord ye Angels of his, ye that excel in ſtrength, ye that fulfill his commands, and hearken unto the voice of his words,</hi> Pſal. 103.20, 21. Therefore certainly, they that fulfil <hi>Gods command,</hi> and <hi>hearken to his voice,</hi> will be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154195:81"/> farre enough from cauſing others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that which they hate, eſpecially in the Children of God, for whoſe ſakes they are made miniſtring Spirits. But then ſome will be ready to excuſe themſelves, and lay the fault upon the Devil and his evil Angels: it is true, the Prince of the Aire rules in the children of diſobedience; but it is as true, they give up themſelves unto him, their luſts firſt ruled in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, before Satan got domination over their hearts; they are taken captives at his pleaſure, but they firſt give up themſelves willingly to be captivated, they are willing to lie under the yoke of Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, nor care they for other freedome then what the ſervice of ſinne will allow of; and therefore our Saviour tels the Jews, <hi>You are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father you will doe.</hi> The luſts of your father you will obey; you have a luſt to doe whatſoever he wills, and your will is bent to doe whatſoever your luſt dictates; and yet men would fain make God the author of their evil, as if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that to come upon them which they cannot refuſe. <hi>To this end</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin) evil men lay not the blame of their vicious actions upon their evil nature, but upon the Stars, or on Gods peremptory Decree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as what is ſinne, is voluntary, and what is not voluntary is not ſinne.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154195:82"/> 
               <hi>Ye have yeilded your members ſervants unto ſinne.</hi> So that we muſt not lay the fault upon the Stars, but upon our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wills; for though the Stars doe draw vicious paſſions, as in melancholy hearts, in ſome anger, and in others wanton love, &amp;c. And though by nature we readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeild to thoſe influences, yet there is power in grace, which is able, and doth break in every regenerate man the power of the Stars: But if we give up our ſelves to ſinne, we muſt needs yeild unto thoſe evil paſſions, whereas a wiſe man, even by his very reaſon, will domineer over the malignant influence of any Star; and though the corruption of our nature, or the evil influence of the Stars, may incline us to any kinde of vice, as lying, ſtealing, to commit adultery, &amp;c. yet as we are rational creatures we may and ought to ſtrive againſt them, labouring to get power from above to aſſiſt us: and to that end is it that we are born again by holy Baptiſme; for this cauſe came we into the Chriſtian Church, that we might no longer live after the luſts of the Gentiles which know not God, but that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the luſts of the fleſh, following godlineſs with the greateſt eagerneſs, and ſharpeſt conflicts that a renewed heart can uſe againſt ſtubborn and rebellious fleſh, that our whole man may be woun<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154195:83"/> miſcheivous head was early broke by the promiſed Seed (the true Meſſiah) whom the Patriarchs foreſaw, and the Prophets foretold: The Patriarchs foreſaw him, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 49.10. The Prophets foretold him under diverſe repreſentations, <hi>Eſay,</hi>

            <p>That God ſhould be Incarnate, that ſinners ſhould be ſaved, that a deſpicable man ſhould ſave a World, was thought ſo incredible, that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> cryes out, <hi>Who hath beleeved our report?</hi> (which was in time fulfilled, <hi>But when the fulneſſe of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 4.4.) though the newes was true, and proclaimed from Heaven by an Angel, and that of great Joy, for that on this day was born a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt the Lord; what was in the Prophets propheſied concerning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was by himſelf fulfilled in time; what they pointed at, he pointed out, and by a Miracle ſhewed it to the Wiſe Men, ſaying, <hi>Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes? for we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, and we are come to worſhip him,</hi> St. Matthew 2.2. Yet when he came to his own, they received him not, but rejected the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God, as they did that ſlew the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154195:84"/> Prophets, who declared the coming of the juſt One; for when he was come, he was forced to be gone, and flie for the ſafety of his life into a forraign Country, to avoid the fury of that mighty <hi>Nimrod,</hi> whoſe pretended worſhip was onely the dark vizour of an inhumane murder; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing his wicked purpoſes under the beautiful mask of a deſired amity: no wonder therefore, that there are ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us that call themſelves Chriſts, when there are thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, that would, and doe diſown Chriſts Nativity; and this old <hi>Simeon</hi> (by inſpiration) calculated at his Nativity, ſaying, <hi>This child is ſet for a ſigne which ſhall be ſpoken againſt,</hi> St. Luke 2.34. And wicked people make it good, as if he had not been foretold by Prophets, nor come into the world in the fulneſſe of time at an appointed day; <hi>and that for us men, and for our Salvation, Chriſt came down from Heaven, and was incarnate in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin Mary:</hi> it is a work that many would not believe, ſaith God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.5. which was fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. <hi>Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, for I work a work in your dayes, a work which you ſhall not beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> For ſo would they have hindred the Author and finiſher of our Faith from working that which he had wrought, and what God

            <p n="2">2. The End; and that pointed at, and pointed out:
<list>

            </p>
            <p>And ſince the end is the firſt thing in the intention, though laſt in execution, I did begin with the end</p>
            <p>Pointed at, and that was <hi>to this end,</hi> and <hi>for this cauſe:</hi> But</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the proper work of this day, Chriſts Nativity; <hi>I was born, I came into the world:</hi> and here at the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154195:85"/> firſt ſtep of our diſcourſe, we are plunged into an unfathomed depth of myſtery; for this he that was here borne, is the ſame he that calls himſelf <hi>I am that I am, Exodus</hi> 3.14. That Socinian that ſaith he was not very God, is a blaſphemer; <hi>I am that I am,</hi> it is the Name of God, whoſe Eſſence is from everlaſting to everlaſting, and to be born notes his humanity; and how this work was, that he that is <hi>I am</hi> ſhould be borne, and cloſe with the Deity, tongue cannot expreſſe, and heart cannot conceive; we can conceive how nothing is but what is in and of our ſelves, and not that neither but with much imperfection; for the firſt of us that was ſo deſirous of knowledge, left us nothing but a penury of what we were; and if we know not our ſelves, we cannot poſſibly conceive how God was made man, and at the ſame time remain incommunicable; or how he being incommunicable, did vouchſafe to partake of humane Nature; yet thus was Chriſt both God and Man in the ſame perſon; as man he had a mother that bare him, and as God a Father that begat him: but who can without admiration ſpeak of ſuch a Sonne, or tell of ſuch a generation, that was like both, &amp; yet like neither? like neither; for conſider him as Man, and ſo he hath no ſimilitude of an ineffable Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; look upon him as God, and ſo he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154195:85"/> bears no proportion with the Virgins Womb; and yet like both; as God, like his Father, as man, like his mother; God and yet the ſonne of a woman; Man, and ſtill the Image of his Father, and that from Eternity, being <hi>without beginning of dayes, or end of time;</hi> Gods Son and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, a Virgins Babe and Fatherleſſe; without a Father as borne of a Woman, and without a Mother as begotten of God: Thus was he God and motherleſſe, as begotten and not borne; a man and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, becauſe borne and not begotten; we muſt beleeve both beyond enquiry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more is poſſible with God then is conceiveable with man, and divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould perſwade us to beleeve that they are undoubted truths, though our reaſon cannot comprehend them; for what we cannot underſtand by beleeving, we muſt believe beyond underſtanding; and of all the divine Myſteries, this of our bleſſed Saviours Incarnation eſpecially, whoſe very myſtery heightens Faith to no leſſe then a Miracle; and where a Miracle is wrought wonder muſt needs be created, and both theſe two meet in this one act of Faith, exerciſed about the hypoſtaticall union; for beleeving we wonder, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling we beleeve, and make our bleſſed Saviours Incarnation the object of both; we beleeve what we marvell at, and yet
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154195:86"/> wonder at our Faith, ſtill doubling the Miracle by marvelling that we can at once both wonder and beleeve: it is a wonder, and yet this wonder is the object of our Faith; for how can we doe leſſe then marvell, when we conſider that on the Fathers ſide he ſhould be God and no man, on the Mothers ſide man and no God, and yet both God and Man? For Eternity had begotten man but once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe begotten from Eternity; his Father begot him equall to God, his Mother bare him like to Man; he was man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God, and therefore Man and no God, and yet God and Man, for when he was made man he ceaſed not to be God which he was before: like as the Sun loſeth not its brightneſſe, though ſhadowed in the clouds; ſo not Chriſt his glory, though obſcuted in fleſh, he was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Mother as to be ſeparated from his Father; Chriſt was not leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to his Fathet by being like his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> St. John 1.14. and not leſſe Word then Fleſh, by an aſſumption of the fleſh, not conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word; the Word that God by fleſh did preſent to our ſight was real Fleſh, and was not leſſe God ſtill; for he is no leſſe God now that he is clad in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane clay, then when onely clothed with deified Glory; he remaines God and Man
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154195:86"/> in one perſon, very God and very Man in one ſingular ſubſiſtence, he took the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Man, and the ſubſtance, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the perſon to his proper being; and that this may not altogether ſeeme ſtrange to your underſtandings, pleaſe to turn your eyes inward, and an example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be preſented; for if man hath the life of Plants, and the ſenſe of Beaſts, and both in conjunction with the reaſonable ſoul in an individual being, why may not Chriſt take the Soul of man into union with himſelf, and yet conſiſt in his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, making a Trinity in the union of his Perſon? For as he was God and Man in the humane nature, he conſiſted of a Deity, a ſoul and a body, there a Trinity in unity, here unity in Trinity; he was one perſon not divided, a perſon of the Trinity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, not divided; for every perſon in the Sacred Trinity is perfect God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into perſons, but not divided in ſubſtance, for all take propriety each with the other; the Father God, the Son God, and the holy Ghoſt God, and yet not three, but one God, as we are taught by the holy Catholick Faith to beleeve; yet that God might redeeme us from our iniquities, he that was perfect God equal with the Father, took upon him our fleſh, and therefore it is that God was ſaid to ſuffer what man himſelf ſhould have borne;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154195:87"/> onely here is the admired union of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but not natural of perſons,</p>
            <p>But what were the reaſons why he whoſe name is <hi>I am</hi> ſhould be borne, ſo as to ſay of himſelf, <hi>To this end was I borne, and for this cauſe came I into the world, to bear witneſſe to the truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To make God and Man one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement; and therefore it was neceſſary he ſhould be of both natures, whoſe office is to reconcile both perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was to doe that for us which was impoſſible for man to doe, and to ſuffer what was unmeet for God to undergoe; and that he might both doe and ſuffer for us he took the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for his mother, that from her he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a body capable of ſuffering; but it was his Divinity which enabled his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſuffer what our Souls deſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was to undergoe for an infinite offence, for man had ſinned, and none but God could ſatisfie for an infinite of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it being reaſonable that the ſame nature that broke the Law ſhould pay the Debt; and therefore it was neceſſary for him to be God as well as Man, that did undertake to make God and Man to be reconciled and made one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had he been God and not Man, man could not have been redeemed; had he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154195:87"/> been onely man and not God, the Devils would have boaſted; but he was both God and man, that our redemption might be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the Devils malice ſilenced: whence wiſely was our redemption ſhared between God and man, becauſe the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſuch, that a mere man could not undertake to appeaſe a God offended nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one nor the other nature would have, or could have relieved us ſingle, becauſe he muſt be God that will be mediator from God to man, and he muſt be man that he may be an interceſſor to God for man: and this myſtery though our reaſon cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, yet our belief muſt reach it, our faith muſt believe what our hearts and tongues cannot expreſſe, &amp; our faith is then profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent when it hath attained ſo high, and not before; for we can ſay more by ſilence then by words, &amp; when we find him in our ſouls by <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and praiſe, we ſhall then know thee O Saviour, not for thy ſelf, but our ſelves, and it is our faith to believe that as thou art ſo ſhall we be, though not ſo fully: therefore let every one make it his requeſt, <q>O that thou wouldſt come down from heaven, and dwell in our hearts by faith and love, who out of love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind came in fleſh, when faith and truth were baniſhed out of the earth; and that thou ſhouldſt ſo come as to ſay, <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154195:88"/> the world, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And ſo much may ſuffice for that part of his incarnation, the end of his coming. I now come to that of his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>his coming into the world,</hi> and here three things are to be conſidered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Dignity of his perſon.</item>
               <item>2. The Humility of his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention.</item>
               <item>3. The Place of his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The Dignity of his perſon, in that he was the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Humility of his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that he would clothe himſelf with the rags of our mortality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Place, unworthy of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being the world.</p>
            <p>Of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Dignity of his perſon, and that as he is the Sonne of God by nature, and as in his Birth the moſt noble perſon that ever was; on the Fathers ſide he is God, very God, the very God of one ſubſtance with the Father, as you have heard, and which to deny is no leſſe then blaſphemy, for when he calls God Father, the <hi>Iewes</hi> knew that thereby <hi>he made himſelf equall with God,</hi> St. John 10.33. He as Gods Sonne was alwayes with the Father, and ſo everlaſtingly great as he was God; and not onely ſo, but he was full of dignity on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154195:88"/> his Mothers ſide, as he was deſcended from the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Royal Kings</hi> of <hi>Iudah;</hi> ſo he was a Prince renowned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For his authority, <hi>becauſe he doth what he will, both in heaven and in earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 13.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>in the ſea, and in all deep places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For his power,<note place="margin">St. Mar. 4.41.</note> he commands <hi>the wind, and the waves, and they obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For the largeneſs of his dominions, <hi>heaven and earth is his,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 72.8.</note> and <hi>the fulneſs thereof; his dominion is from one part of heaven and earth unto the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. For multitude of Subjects; <hi>Angels, Saints</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> yea and thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Kings</hi> are his Subjects, either volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily or againſt their wils, for he ſits down among the Gods.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For laſting, his Dominion is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and <hi>he ſhall reign over the houſe of Iacob for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11, 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>and of his Kingdome there ſhall be no end,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For fulneſs, <hi>In his preſence is fulneſs of joy</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For ſubduing of enemies; <hi>Bring thoſe my enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">St. Luke 19.27.</note> But why go I about to deſcribe that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or blazon the glory of a power that is incomprehenſible? It made holy <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.4.</note> Man is as a thing of nought, for when he was not guilty, being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154195:89"/> innocent, and had not ſinned, he could me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit no favour; but when he was guilty, and by ſinning had deſerved not to be what he was before, yet then, God to ſhew the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mercy, that he who had made the world for man, would not make man for nothing, and though his <hi>Image</hi> was defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, yet he would not have it rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; that goodneſs that planted him in uprightneſs, would not have him preſently deſtroyed when found in wickedneſs; no, he was prone to mercy, though provoked to wrath by beholding that in man which his infinite Power never created; and therefore to this purpoſe he came into the world,<note place="margin">1 St. John 3.8.</note> that <hi>he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>To apply this.</head>

Or on the contrary, let us not ſuppoſe our ſins to be

                  <p>His firſt coming under the Law in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical types is not here intended, but the coming mentioned in this place is his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, when he came as a Saviour to give the Goſpel; Chriſt Jeſus, who is God-man, thus came into the world, and becauſe as God he is omnipreſent, ſome will have his preſence in every place, and his being in every thing; 'tis true, he was with us before he came to us, but that God that is omnipreſent, and fils all places, yet hath divers tranmſiſſions in Scripture; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is his place or throne of glory, and earth his foot-ſtool; but he is ſaid to come to us, when he manifeſts himſelf to us after
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154195:90"/> a new manner, and this coming of his is by an act of new Mercy; he that is all Mercy, now vouchſafed to his Creatures a new way of coming, ſuch as was never mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted before, for he came to the old world in types and figures, he was <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> when the Elect was, Chriſt was there, not only as the ſecond perſon in the ſacred Trinity, but as <hi>a Propitiation</hi> for man; in ſhort, he alwayes came in purpoſe, he early came in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and he ſucceſsfully came in <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time;</hi> the Promiſes could not be fruſtrated, and the Prophets could not be miſtaken; he is given to us in the Goſpel, and married to us by his Spirit, having aſſumed our fleſh in the bleſſed Virgin; and that he ſhould thus come to us was great humility from ſitting in Heaven and hearing the Quire of Angels ſinging his praiſes, working wonders in heaven and in earth, &amp;c. yet he forſook all this to find us out, who were rolling in clay; for when he came to glorifie our nature we were in trouble, we could be found in no condition but that of miſery, when he <hi>bowed the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and came down,</hi> he then turned the name of Majeſty into Pity, his Glory into Humility, and laying aſide his Glory, he leapt from that his Greatneſs, and came and dwelt among us, clothed in fleſh: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had he come in the form of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154195:91"/> that had been condeſcention; or but to our fleſh, or had he but come to the circumciſion of his fleſh, that had been a large extent of his love, for his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was no other than the ſhedding of his moſt precious bloud, one drop whereof would have been ſufficient for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of a world; but he took upon him the form of a ſervant, and that to waſh his Diſciples feet, which was a ſtep lower for God to tread; nay lower than that, <hi>he humbled himſelf to the death, and that of the croſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Phil. 8.</note> where he found his enemies to be his Judges, and thoſe that hated him, falſly to accuſe his ſacred Works; but both divided, for there you have one drawing up a charge againſt his life, and here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwering for his life; here one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his innocency, there another cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, he is guilty; yet notwithſtanding, amidſt the many divided tongues there are found ſome united hands to ſlay him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Atheiſts ſcoffe at this, ſaying, ſhall we begin our Religion at a Babe in the manger? or believe in him whoſe pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo great, that to pay tribute for his allegiance, was fain to be obliged to a Fiſh for money? whoſe penury neceſſitated him to beg for a living? who was hungry, and thirſty, and ſleepy, and ſorrowful, yea ſo deſpicably mean and contemptible, that his own kindred was ready to lay hands on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154195:91"/> him, as one out of his wits? and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained for want of lodging, eſteeming himſelf more deſpicable than the <hi>foxes</hi> of the earth, or the <hi>fowles</hi> in the air: this was the eſteem, or very little better, which the world had of him, of whom they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy, not conſidering why he ſo came, for he came to be thus mean, that we might become honourable; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he come to be killed by ſinners, that ſinners might live in his death; to die for them, that they might die to ſin; and though they now crucifie afreſh the Son of God by their iniquities, yet a time will come when they will be glad of the ſaving virtue of one drop of that bloud which they now diſgrace.</p>

               <p>If the Son of God came in ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as to humble himſelf to come into the world to die for us; why ſhould we disdain to do our friends good, though never ſo mean, even to the degree of a ſervant, ſeeing that when the Son of God came to redeem us, he did it in the form of a ſervant?

               <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, to bear witneſs to the truth.</hi> Truth is threefold:
<list>
                  <item>1. There is the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning the Meſſias.</item>
                  <item>2. The truth of the Subſtance, whereof the Types were but ſhadowes.</item>
                  <item>3. The truth of the Doctrines deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the people.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The truth of Gods promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſias, he was promiſed in the beginning of time to him that was to be the Father of all living; for when God had made man a living Soul, and man by ſinne had made himſelf a dying body, then was the promiſe of a quickning ſpirit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. She that was accurſed for eating the forbidden fruit, ſhall now be bleſt in the fruit of her body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God promiſed him to the father of all living, ſo to the father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. and it was to procure our good; <hi>For in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Gen. 18.18. In him we have freedome from miſery, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of glory, and by him we have intereſt in glory, and comfort in calamity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God promiſed Chriſt by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and not onely that he ſhould, but how he muſt be borne:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154195:98"/> 
               <hi>Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive, &amp; bear a Son, and call his name Emanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. How he ſhould die; <hi>After threeſcore and two weeks ſhall the Meſſiah be cut off, but not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Dan. 9.26. How he ſhould riſe again; <hi>for thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, nor ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 16.10. Thus the Prophets foretold the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt, together with the ſeveral gradations thereof: but if you pleaſe we will once more conſider the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as chalked out in the Old Teſtament, you find him promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be of the <hi>tribe of Iudah,</hi> Gen. 49.10. his <hi>conception, birth, death</hi> and <hi>paſſion</hi> at large ſet down by the Pſalmiſt in the 22. Pſal. his being <hi>derided</hi> at, and <hi>lightly eſteemed,</hi> his being <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling,</hi> and a <hi>rock of offence,</hi> expreſſed in the 118. Pſa. nay foretold to be of the body of <hi>Mary, Iſa.</hi> 7. &amp;c. Hath God ſpoken, and will he not do? no, he ſpake that he might do it, yea he came to bear witneſs of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they might have a conſummation, not a conſumption; for as God promiſed, and the Prophets foretold, ſo he was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for in the beginning; and in the fulneſs of time he came, beeauſe ſo promiſed; for the promiſes are the moſt and beſt part of his word: we expect nothing but promiſes, and of all the promiſes, none but Chriſt; for it is his mercy, not our deſerts, <hi>that all the promiſes are in Chriſt yea and amen.</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:154195:99"/> Thus you ſee the firſt truth demonſtrated, the truth of Gods promiſe in ſending the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The truth of the ſubſtance, whereof the types and figures under the law were but ſhadowes: how many things were there that preſented Chriſt? nay, in every thing where and when was not Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured? each promiſe and prophecy ſpeaks nothing foretold which he did not fulfil and do, that the ſhadowes might yield to the ſubſtance, that the types might have accompliſhment as well as abrogation, Chriſt came into the world; all the types end in him, <hi>He came to witneſs to the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The truth of doctrines of faith and manners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the doctrine of faith, take this inſtance; the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> hath foretold, that <hi>thoſe that ſate in darkneſs have ſeen a great light,</hi> Iſa. 9.2. and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>this is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> St. John 1.9. indeed concerning the doctrines of faith, there were divers in the world, ſome were falſe, and ſome likely, but the moſt true; the firſt two were they of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the third of our Saviour; and how falſe they of the Philoſophers were, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to moſt, for they often changed the truth of God into lies, and truth was vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154195:99"/> from thoſe children of men; ſome of them fancied many gods, ſome believed no God at all; ſome granted an eternal being but no providence; and ſome a providence, and yet did attribute all to fate; but Chriſt came to maintain a <hi>Trinity</hi> of perſons, and that in a divine <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and that he takes care of the whole world, and doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate any mans actions by a fatal deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And not onely were there errors in mens judgements, but</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their manners and waies: how great the errors of the Philoſophers were, is well known to thoſe that are and have been converſant in their writings; and not onely they, but the Rabbins of old under the law, taught againſt literal hypocriſie, that no obedience is profitable, if it be not in obſervation of the whole Law; and that not then neither, but when onely in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to mans appearance: but Chriſt when he came, he required truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and what they ſtood for in the letter he required in the ſpirit, expounding their doctrine more ſtrictly, ſaying, <hi>It hath been ſaid of old, Thou ſhalt not kill, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the judgement; but I ſay unto you, whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger of the judgement,</hi> as is ſet down the 5, 6, 7. chap. of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Chriſt came to witneſs to the truth, and did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154195:100"/> to it in his Sermons, Judgements and Cenſures, Anſwers and Reproofes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his Sermons; that his adverſaries could not but paſſe this cenſure of them, <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth.</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 22.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his judgements and cenſures; for how did he uſe in reading, pleading, and deciding, to demonſtrate his faithfulneſs? you have the full ſtory of the firſt of theſe in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 7.4. and ſo on, concerning his willingneſs to forgive the greateſt debt: an example of the ſecond is pregnant to this purpoſe, when he defended the pious woman againſt his Diſciples for <hi>anointing his Head with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ointment</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.10, 11, 12, 13. You have his faithfulneſs in the third, when againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> he became an advocate for himſelf, to defend that true power which the Father had committed to him, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.12. and ſo on.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his Anſwers and Reproofes; in his anſwers, though they were many times in ſilence, yet he convinced them by ſaying nothing; and in his reproofes how true? for when he ſpake, they were ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man uttered, for faithfull, ſeaſonable, and meek, never expreſſing any ſeeming paſſion but once, in purging the Temple
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154195:100"/> of thoſe buyers and ſellers, who had made his Fathers houſe a place of Merchandiſe, and inſtead of the houſe of Prayer, had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a Den of Theeves: indeed he ſpared neither friend nor foe; for when he reproved his Diſciples, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 9.46. upon their contention for greatneſs, he did it in meekneſs, by the innocent ſimilitude of a Child, <hi>ver.</hi> 48.</p>
            <p>When to the Phariſees, he ſaid, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees hypocrites, for ye are like unto whited ſepulchers, which indeed appear beautifull outwardly, but are within full of dead mens bones:</hi> he did it in faithfulneſs, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.27. And even of <hi>Herod</hi> he ſaid no leſſe, nor ſhewed he any fear of his power; for he ſaid, <hi>Goe ye, and tell that Fox, behold, I caſt out Devils, and I doe cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. whereby you ſee, he alwayes bare witneſs to the truth; and wherein elſe ſhould we follow his example? for every one, is obliged in word and work, in life and in death, to bear witneſs to the truth, every man in his place and calling. Indeed there is a ſpeciall duty lies upon Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and all publick Officers, that they in their ſeverall ſpheres, move exemplarily towards the mark of truth; but moſt of all, upon the Miniſters of the bleſſed Word and Sacraments; for that which is laid upon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154195:101"/> on them by way of obligation, is double, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come into the world, the Church, as members thereof, and Officers therein; and that extraordinarily as called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, inwardly, by the Spirit of God, and outwardly ſent by thoſe, that have power in the Church, lawfully to commiſſion them thereunto; and then they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged alſo to bear witneſs to the truth; as common Chriſtians in their degree, that they may bear witneſs to the truth, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of goodneſs following the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of all good, that good man, God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who left us his example as a pattern to imitate; who was full of <hi>Humility,</hi> ſtrong in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loeving,</hi> wonderfull in <hi>patience,</hi> rich in <hi>love,</hi> and in all a patterne of <hi>Holineſs:</hi> and it is the higheſt reaſon imaginable, that we ſhould imitate him whom we pretend to worſhip, being carefull that we bring no diſhonour to his name, by doing what he did not, or in refuſing to doe what he did and commanded; but rather looking upon him as the author and finiſher of our Faith, we may be ingaged <hi>to run</hi> (as he did) <hi>with patience the race that is ſet before us,</hi> taking all manner of encouragement from him; that ſo if we are unable, or unwilling to follow Chriſt in his Word commanding, yet we may doe it by his Word directing. And what though Chriſtians meet with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154195:101"/> dealings from men? yet they muſt not turn away their ears from hearing, nor their tongues from ſpeaking, nor their lives from ſuffering for the truth, if called thereunto: for ſince they were borne for this end, to follow the great examplary who died for witneſſing to the truth, they muſt not baſely decline it; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo I have done with the words in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary intention, as they concerned our Saviour; and come now</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the extenſion of them, as they concerne us; for ſince Chriſt in the whole courſe of his life is preſented as a pattern of Holineſs, we that profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſtians, our eyes muſt ſo look to Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our Faith, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, and as he did, ſo we ſhould bear witneſs to the truth: and to this end were we borne, and for this cauſe came we into the world, that we ſhould bear witneſs to the truth. And ſo I begin again with</p>
            <p>The act, <hi>to bear witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though all the Sacred Word be called a teſtimony, becauſe ſufficient to bear witneſs to it ſelf; yet God will have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very truth of his eſtabliſhed by the mouths and lives of Chriſtians alſo; and for this cauſe, beſides others, came Chriſt into the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154195:102"/> world: yea Chriſt, who is the Word and Truth it ſelf, took the witneſs of others to himſelf, and joyned himſelf to their witneſs; for the whole ſacred Trinity bears record of his truth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Father, and that to the Saints of old, he did then bear witneſs of him; the ſubſtance whereof was audibly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that voice, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him, St.</hi> Matthew 17.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Word; he did bear witneſs to himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>I am from him, and he hath ſent me, Saint</hi> John 7.29. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. The holy Ghoſt in Scripture teſtifies of him; yea all the Scriptures, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.8. And all the teſtimonies therein that ſpeak of him, whether it be by way of promiſe, or propheſie, you ſhall finde them all meeting as ſo many lines in this one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. Yea, the Scriptures of the New Teſtament eſpecially clearly ſet down all the parts of his incarnation, both as to the divine and humane nature.</p>

               </gap> have its teſtimony from Heaven, and by the Scriptures, beſides the witneſs of men; and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that man is ſuch a flatterer of his own reaſon and knowledge, that he is apt to have a better conceit of himſelf then Divine rules and principles; he thinks to guide himſelf well enough without the aſſiſtance of Almighty God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that many are ſo ſtudious to finde out ſome unheard of thing, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make themſelves the authors, and inventers of ſomething that may make them ſeeme wiſer then their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and at laſt to lay aſide the rules of God, as if they knew what was fitter and better for them then he: and much, if not all of this is to be found in thoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and reformations which have been made upon the worſhip, and ſervice of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154195:103"/> God; men have itching eares, deviſing new opinions, and profeſsing extraordinary lights and revelations, ſuch ſtrange ſtuffe as our Fathers never knew, nor we ever heard of before; and being Authors thereof themſelves, they highly extol their own conceptions, looking upon well-ordered and religious diſcipline as no better than popiſh zeal, and ſuperſtitious worſhip; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding even to the queſtioning of the Truths of God, and the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, whether plainly or covertly laid down in his holy Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing is more loud than errors, and the more falſe the matter, the more loud the clamour, getting more voices for its entertainment than truth can find; for every illiterate tongue is ready to cry out, <hi>Great is Diana,</hi> and with the noiſe of their new erected goodneſs, quite ſtop their ears againſt all religious ſerving of the true God; yea, we find this project to have been practiſed of old, where we read of their inhumane zeal in burning their children, and making them paſſe through the fire to <hi>Moloch;</hi> &amp; that the people might not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt them for their cruelty, nor themſelves moved to pitty, they had the noiſe of Inſtruments to drown the cryes of their children, that their voice might not be heard. And in alluſion to this I may ſay, that the loud cry of error and hereſie may be ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:154195:103"/> great in a Nation, that the voice of one man or more that is faithful, and would plead in defence of truth, cannot poſſibly be heard, but may be over-born by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; becauſe each man will have his vote, and as much, if not more, talk than he; yet know this, that one <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſpeaking from the Oracle of God, is better than many <hi>Balaams</hi> offering ſacrifices, and curſed devotions from inchanted Altars; whoſe great conſpiracy is only to work the ruine of Gods people: yea ſuch is the wickedneſs of ungodly men, that if a <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſpeak the truth, he muſt preſently ſuffer, and be buffeted on the cheek with a contumelious reproof; ſaying (as that wicked one did) <hi>Which way went the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God from me to ſpeak unto thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.23. the truth is, none are more ready to boaſt of the Spirit of God, than they that have it not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The wickedneſs of mens lives is ſuch, that Gods glory loſes much honour by them, and therefore he is pleaſed to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf by bearing witneſs to the truth by his own Word; <hi>Many,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, ſhall follow their pernicious wayes, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of,</hi> 2. St. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.2. not ſo much neither by the blaſphemy of tongues, and Jewiſh calumnies, as by thoſe that have the confidence to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154195:104"/> Chriſtians; the wickedneſs of whoſe actions cauſeth Gods glorious Name to be diſhonoured, and thoſe ſacred Truths (that ought to be prized and valued above gold and ſilver, or any earthly treaſure) ſo much as in them lies, is diſgraced by their unholy converſations, who prefer lying vanities before them; the conſideration whereof ſhould make thoſe that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed to defend truth againſt the loud noiſe of errors, and preſerve it againſt the malice of thoſe that ſtudy nothing ſo much as to contradict it; for this end are we made Chriſtians, for this cauſe do we receive a ſecond birth, for this end are we made members of the holy Catholick Church, namely, that we ſhould defend the Truths of God with our lives and eſtates: though it muſt be granted, that truth lyes not within the power of men, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Devils, that they ſhould harm it; Truth is not leſſe glorious in it ſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradicted, but only in the worlds eſtimation; Truth is of the nature of God, whoſe Glory is not capable of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diminution, though God is ſaid to be glorified by his creatures ſerving of him now you muſt not ſuppoſe it to ariſe from any addition we can make to his Glory, but only a ſatisfaction he is pleaſed to take in beholding our obedience to his Will; for though we be never ſo wicked,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154195:104"/> yet we muſt continually conclude, thou art <hi>holy,</hi> O thou <hi>holy</hi> One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that art the ſame for ever and changeſt not: and as is God himſelf, the ſame is his Truth, whoſe Excellency lies in this, that it is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its being, it is that Verity unto which nothing can be added or ſubſtracted; for if the one were found, the other would neceſſarily follow, as we find it by daily experience, that thoſe things that may be extended may alſo be contracted, and where there is room for addition, there will be alſo place found for ſubſtraction; but God and his Truth can have nothing added or taken from them; the higheſt part of our greatneſs being unable to reach the loweſt part of his Glory, and when we have ſaid all that can be expreſſed, we can ſay nothing more than this, that he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; for when we magnifie God, we only expreſs him great, but do not thereby make him great; when we blaſpheme him, we indeavour our utmoſt to leſſen his Glory, but no harm can we do thereby to him, though very much to our ſelves, by increaſing our own miſery; and when we praiſe him, it ſhews our endeavours to make him great, but nothing is added to his Greatneſs by our exultations: when we oppoſe his Power, it is not he, but our ſelves that receive damage by the ſame; ſo likewiſe when we witneſs to the Truth,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154195:105"/> it is not God, but our ſelves that are made the better by our fidelity; for the Truth makes us free, when in witneſſing we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with our lips, &amp; profeſs in our lives that Divine Truth. Thus to give teſtimony (indeed) to that Truth will ſave our ſouls from death eternal, and bring them to the poſſeſſion of Glory everlaſting; for it is Truth that will bring benefit unto us, and not we to the Truth; but the aim of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in calling us to be his Servants and Miniſters, is, that we ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by witneſſing to the Truth, for the Truth of God is not the greater by it, but only appears the more glorious in us; the better we are made by the Truths of God, the more glory we bring to the God of Truth: There are two things, the <hi>apple</hi> of a mans <hi>eye,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which of all things in the world are the moſt tender, and which may be eaſily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the one with a mote, the other with a ſcruple; therefore it concernes us, as we are men, to preſerve the one, and as we are Chriſtians to beware of the other, leſt through our unholy converſations the way of truth come to be evil ſpoken of. Indeed it is every mans duty to know tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what may, and what muſt not be done, when perſecutions ariſe; and accordingly there are four things principally conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary reſpecting Truth.</p>

            <p n="1">1. If perſonal perſecutions ariſe, then light is neceſſary to direct a man whether it be lawful for him to fly, or to ſtand ſtill and undergo the cruelty of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; indeed our Saviour ſaith, <hi>When one is ſought he muſt fly from one city to another, St. Matth.</hi> 10.23. but he meanes of a perſonal perſecution, when a man hath no publick charge committed to him, then he may lawfully fly to ſecure himſelf; but if otherwiſe he have a charge under him, as ſuppoſe him a Miniſter of the bleſſed Word and Sacraments, then he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Flock, for the Church muſt not be forſaken for the fear of undergoing the wrath of men, leſt his flight ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them to errors and hereſie; for when a common perſecution of the Sheep and the Shepherd comes both together, it is altogether unlawful for a Shepherd to flie: <hi>A good Shepheard layes down his life for his Sheep,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.11. and though a man may uſe all lawful
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154195:106"/> means to preſerve his life, when a ſingle perſecution ariſes, as by flight, or other wayes; yet it is not ſo when it comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both the Shepherd and the Flock; for a Shepherd by dying or ſuffering for them may preſerve his Flock from ruine: I ſay, then a Shepherd ſhould rather chuſe to have his own body mangled alone; or if that will not ſatisfie their rage, then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and cheerfully he muſt make one with the butcher'd Flock, rather than leave his Sheep in the way of perſecuters cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore I wonder not at the juſt retaliation of Gods Vengeance upon thoſe, who for ſelf-preſervation diſſemble the truth: and that brings me to the ſecond thing conſiderable;</p>

Diſſimulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be of men, or of truth; if underſtood of men, then it is an hiding or diminution of ſuch a man that is ſought for, and inquired after by perſecutors, as if he were not in being, or as if ſuch an one never had been; and thus to do is unlawful: ſo likewiſe in matter of truth and faith, as it is lawful for a man not to detect himſelf, but to carry himſelf as purely from the bloud of all men, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to preſerve his own, ſo far as ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation brings no diſhonour to God and his Truth; for what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth like a good Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt: though it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154195:106"/> ſometimes we find in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that men have taken the ſafeſt way they could to come to Chriſt, as <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> did <hi>when he came by night,</hi> in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.26. and likewiſe <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathea</hi> came ſecretly <hi>to beg the body of Ieſus for fear of the Iews,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.38. and though, I ſay, we find ſo much done in holy Writ, yet it was through the greatneſs of their infirmities; for the one being a great man, a Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the other a Counſellor, they ſhould have been as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary as their places, for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of others to ſeek after life, it being the glory of ſuch perſons to attract goodneſs as well as greatneſs. Indeed I grant, that the beſt of Saints want not their infirmities, and that the beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot keep in ſuch a reſolution, as may inable them always to be in a readineſs to ſuffer; for we are commanded to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſerpentine, and ſerpentinely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; yet thus much I do affirm, that no man can keep himſelf a true Chriſtian, that is either aſhamed or afraid to be thought a Chriſtian; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me and my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed when he ſhall come in his own glory,</hi> St. Luke 9.26. And though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If thou haſt faith have it to thy ſelf,</hi> Rom. 14.22. as if a man might conceal his faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154195:107"/> leſſe, for he ſpeaketh it not of thoſe things which we are to believe as neceſſary unto ſalvation, but of thoſe things which are in different in themſelves, &amp; may or may not be done, as they pleaſe or diſpleaſe our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſuch a faith a man is to keep to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but a faith that contains thoſe things which are neceſſary unto ſalvation he ought not, nor can he, if a real Chriſtian, conceal it in times of perſecution or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, for in ſo doing he brings himſelf to loſe his intereſt in the Promiſes which are made ours in Chriſt Jeſus, only upon the condition of continuing ſtedfaſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving unto the end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Similation, which is a fiction in faith; and another demonſtration of a thing then it is in it ſelf; and for a man to counterfeit any thing in, or againſt, true Religion or the Truths of God, to ſave himſelf in time of perſecution, is altogether unlawful. <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith, <q>When a man hath a ſign of another thing which he is to do, beſides that which is before him, and it proves not a ſign, but he knows it to be really the thing it ſelf which he is to do, then, though an ignorance of what the ſign intended might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him before, becauſe he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning thereof; yet now that he is ſure it is the thing it ſelf, the miſtaking or leaving out but of one circumſtance may make the whole action ſinful, there being no
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154195:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> excuſe to be drawn for the ſame, either from the goodneſs of his perſon now, or the holineſs of his former life, that can make good, or fill up what was wanting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in his actions.</q> Nor is <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable <hi>in feigning himſelf mad before the people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.13. though he was a man after Gods own heart: No, much more is commendable the ſaying of old <hi>Eleazar,</hi> when at the command of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, all were to die that would not eat ſwines fleſh, and when he had eaten it,</hi> or at leaſt ſeemed to eat it <hi>(for he ſpit it out again) and repenting, came of his own accord to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, chooſing to die gloriouſly, rather than live ſtained with ſuch an abomination;</hi> therefore ſaith he excellently, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by friends to bring fleſh of his own, and make as if he obeyed the King in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh taken from the Sacrifice; <hi>It becomes not one of my years to diſſemble; for then any young perſon may think that I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fourſcore years old and ten, were now gone to a ſtrange Religion; and ſo they, through my hypocriſie, and deſire to live a little time, and a moment longer, ſhould be deceived by me, and ſo I get a ſtain, and make my old age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable: and though I ſhould at preſent be delivered from men, yet ſhould I not eſcape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive nor dead:</hi> 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 6.19, 20, 21. When it once comes to this ſtrait, that we muſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154195:108"/> either deny the truth, or fall under the ſword of perſecution, we are rather to die in, or for the Faith, then forſake it: and as we may not, for the ſaving of our lives, doe that which is unlawfull; much leſſe muſt we free our goods from danger by ſimilation, or making a lie; we muſt not ſimilate good into evil, nor truth into falſhood, by wicked words or works; nor ſeeme to doe good when we intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, becauſe of the lye which will lie upon us, and we ſhall be guilty of, for ſo doing; and withall, becauſe there is a lye in deed as well as in ſaying, and neither is allowable in any man, under what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever, though the doing thereof were to ſave his life; <hi>For we muſt not doe evil that good may come thereof,</hi> Rom. 3.8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Deniall of the truth, and that either by ſubſcribing againſt it, or by doing that in our lives and actions which is directly oppoſite unto it; for there is a double denial of truth:

            <q>To this end was I borne, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the truth.</q>
            <p>Truth is the firſt thing in intention, though laſt in enjoyment, as being the end of all; and he that would be happy in the end, muſt lay hold of truth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: it was a queſtion too good for a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> to ask, <hi>What is truth?</hi> St. John 18.38. becauſe his jeſting ſpeech ſhewed he never intended a ſober inquiry after it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:154195:111"/> the Schooles have wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Queſtions raiſed about the power, and Infiniteneſs of God, as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into parts, how all could be in one, and yet that one in all; ſo as that it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into paſt preſent and future, and ſo he hath a time of giving and receiving. Thus the body of the Sunne containes all light eſſentially in it ſelf, and when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Moon and Stars, it is ſtill the ſame, though multiplyed. So is truth, according to the divers acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it; for as it is conſidered in it ſelf, ſo it is one intire being; but as embraced by ſeverall apprehenſions, it is divided, though in it ſelf ſtill the ſame; and this truth is that light which is really <hi>one in all;</hi> yet ſo, as this one light gives information to ſeverall capacities: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is eſſentially, a cauſe of light in the underſtanding; and this the <hi>Schooles</hi> call the <hi>firſt light;</hi> and this you may underſtand, to be as the light in the Sunne, when intire in it ſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated to the leſſer and inferiour Globes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a formal light, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the exerciſing the dictates, and right informations of the underſtanding; and therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> rightly defines truth when exerciſed, <hi>to be the creature of an enlightned underſtanding;</hi> and this created
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:154195:111"/> truth is called, <hi>a life exemplary from the increated truths of God:</hi> and this is as the light of the ſunne-beames to the moon and ſtars, &amp;c. or the diffuſions of truth, from the underſtanding received into all the parts and faculties of the Soul, together with the affections which are as the leſſer ſtars: but beſides this, there is alſo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary light, conformable to the thing expreſt; and this, whether it be in the minde, or in words conceived, or uttered, it muſt firſt ſuppoſe a forme of knowledge, received by the apprehenſion of a man, according to the will of God; and theſe two do but differ as the underſtanding, to the thing conceived; which in it ſelf is ſo neceſſary, that without it no Salvation can be received.</p>
            <p>But then this truth, as it may diverſly be diſtinguiſhed, is not to be the object of our Faith, ſo as that without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof we cannot be happy; for there are truths naturall, and truths theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall; but thoſe truths which we are called out principally to witneſs unto in ſpeaking and doing, by words and workes, are theologicall; and that is, thoſe truths that are declared in the principles of divine Scriptures; and they are the Scriptures of truth, the law of truth, the word of truth, that neceſſarily call for our teſtimony, together with all thoſe doctrines
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154195:112"/> of Faith and manners therein expreſt, as they are reduced from errors; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very divine truth laid down in Scripture, or drawn from Scripture, is that the ſubject we are to bear witneſſe unto; and this is the truth, that containes in it the doctrine of Faith and manners, the one in words, the other in workes; ſo as that we, in teſtimony of words and workes, ſhould bear witneſſe to the truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt bear witneſſe to the doctrines of Faith, by the teſtimony of our words; as <hi>with the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves to righteouſneſſe, ſo with the tongue confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> Rom. 10.10. What we beleeve in our hearts, we muſt confeſſe with our lips, and in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.20. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt confeſſing himſelf not to be Chriſt, it is clear, he denyed not the truth, but onely that he was not the Chriſt; but he that confeſſes not the truth openly, denies Chriſt in that place where God hath ſet him, whether he be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a private man, or a Miniſter; as a Miniſter, he denies Chriſt in words, who is guilty of abuſing the Scriptures by falſe gloſſes, for the countenancing of rebellion or error, either againſt God or man.</p>
            <p>He denies Chriſt as a private man that omits to do what God wills, as well as by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:154195:112"/> doing of that which he nills; you finde this in the ſong of <hi>Deborah,</hi> though they deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to go out to battail, yet becauſe they ſtood ſtill, and appeared not for Iſrael, it is ſaid (by the Angel of the Lord) <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, curſe them bitterly, becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> Jud. 5.23. and wherever there is truth of faith in the heart, there wil be confeſſion of God in the mouth: for confeſſion is an act of faith, <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> &amp;c. he forſakes the truth, that doth not profeſs it in words and works; therefore let not any man think, that onely ſilence, where the truths of God are to be manifeſted, will argue his conſent; for they that will bear witneſs, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth indeed: there is a confeſſion which is onely by conſtraint, even the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and hypocrites do ſo, they will confeſs truth, but they do it with equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for if it be from their minds, it is extorted, or if otherwaies they do it, it is from conviction of conſcience; ſo we find the Egyptian ſorcerers confeſſed, <hi>it was the finger of God,</hi> when they ſaw no likelyhood of longer deceiving the people; for we find by experience, that thoſe that will not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely, ſhall be driven by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to confeſs the truth: thus <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhall bleſs thoſe people for nothing, he was formerly hired to curſe. But though ſome
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154195:113"/> ſpeake well of goodneſs againſt their wills, and by conſtraint, yet a voluntary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the truth beſt becomes a Chriſtian; therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord in your hearts, and be ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to give an anſwer to any man that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſs and fear,</hi> 1 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>But further, it is not enough to witneſs a good confeſſion, though before a <hi>Pilate,</hi> when brought thereunto as a Malefactor, but alſo as a free Chriſtian, thou art bound to profeſs the truth openly, not onely againſt perſecutors, and Schiſmaticks, but alſo againſt Hereticks, and all others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſay, or do any thing that we know is contrary, or againſt the truth; when we ſee men bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <hi>even denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith 2 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2.1. then take heed leſt our ſilence at thoſe be found to give occaſion to men of corrupt minds to ſay, <hi>loe here is Chriſt and there is Chriſt,</hi> as ſome have blaſphemouſly done, and I know you are not ignorant (of that which I tremble to ſpeak) that there are thoſe that call themſelves <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. But I fear they are no better then <hi>Magdalen</hi> but before her converſion; and whence hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but from the unholy converſations of men, ſilently ſuffering the glorious name
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154195:113"/> of Almighty God to be blaſphemed? and now that this wickedneſs is already come to ſo great a fulneſs, ſhall I hold my peace? no, rather ſhall my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, then with ſilence I ſuffer ſuch blaſphemy to go unreproved; the watchman ought alwaies to be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to give the alarum when he ſees the enemy approch, leſt his ſilence incurre the guilt of the peoples blood, if ſhed through his default: and that miniſter that holds his peace, when errors and hereſies begin to deſtroy the Church, and ſervants of God, doth by that his ſilence give conſent to their deſtruction; and <hi>their blood,</hi> if they dy in their ſins, <hi>will God require at his hands, Ezek.</hi> 33.8. and wo unto that man that ſuffers his flock to be ſcattered by his neglect, <hi>and ſo they become meat to all the beaſts of the field, Ezek.</hi> 34.5. for when once the flock is ſcattered they muſt needs be devoured by the wild beaſts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us plainly, that the <hi>Talent</hi> which is not improved in <hi>Gods ſervice, ſhall be taken away from him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto thoſe who have better deſerved it,</hi> Saint <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.28. noting thereby unto us, that we are to improve all the gifts and graces that are in us, for the beſt advantage both of our own, and other ſouls welfare, leſt God charge the loſs of any ſoul upon our account; for certainly if any periſh
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154195:114"/> through our default, the blood of that man ſhall be required at our hands; <hi>and woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. that is, ſurely (above all others) my condition will be extremely ſad, if through my neglect of faithful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the mind of God, any poor ſoul miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry: and as it was the condition of that great Apoſtle, ſo is it of every miniſter of the Goſpel, for we kill thoſe ſouls, we ſee going to deſtruction through ignorance, or otherwaies, and do not admoniſh them: therefore it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the people of God that was for their good,</hi> which makes him truly to boaſt that he was <hi>pure from the blood of all men, Acts</hi> the 20.26. and he himſelf gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his pureneſs, <hi>becauſe he had declared unto them the whole counſel of God, v.</hi> 17. therefore it concerns all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that are faithful to deliver their meſſage truly, not withholding from the people any thing of the whole counſel of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the unwarned ſinner ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will be required at the watchmans hands; therefore ſaith the Lord, Ezek. 33.8. <hi>If thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his evil way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hands:</hi> and for us to be guilty of ſilence, when any of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren go aſtray, is no other then bringing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154195:114"/> their iniquities upon our heads, who are ſet to watch over their ſouls; and ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary a duty to warn people of their ſins, to this end do I come to wait upon you, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the truth, by telling you of thoſe evils that will certainly follow upon unholy walking, and ſinful apprehenſions, either of God or his truth, and Ordinances; <hi>for to this end came every man into the world</hi> (but Miniſters eſpecially) that in words they might bear witneſs to the truth; and not only in words, but</p>
            <p n="2">2. In works alſo, we muſt witneſs to the doctrines of faith by doing, for the teſtimony of the life in action, and the hand in communicating, is far more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then the mouth can expreſs; and not onely muſt we by holy actions do that which may convince and ſtrengthen them that are with us, but alſo by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truth in writing to thoſe that are abſent from us; for the pen conveyeth to many, the tongue but to a few: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of God hath in all ages made proviſion accordingly; to this end were thoſe ſix general Councels held, at <hi>Nice, Trent,</hi> &amp;c. beſides, we find the enemies of the truth are buſie, and careful to inſtruct their followers, by all wayes and means that may make them able to defend error and hereſie: and therefore it would be a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154195:115"/> ſhame to Chriſtianity, that our zeal ſhould not be as great to defend the truth, as the malice of wicked ones is to deſtroy it. O let it never be ſaid of us, that we are ſo careleſs of mens ſouls, that we never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to arm them againſt the errors that riſe up in oppoſition to the truth, but ſuffer the adverſaries thereof to get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt them, and ſo by our negligence and remiſneſs, the undervaluers of truth come to prevail. O let it never be ſpoken, (to our reproch) that they that make it their buſineſs to ſpeak evil of God and Godlineſs, are more induſtrious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote error and hereſie, then we are to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the word of truth in ſincerity: rather let us lift up our voices like trumpets <hi>(and tell Iudah of her ſins, and Iſrael of their tranſgreſſions)</hi> then ſuffer our ſelves to be meal-mouth'd, and afraid to ſpeak againſt error and hereſie, though we ſhould meet with it in robes and gorgeous apparel; for an unfaithful miniſter is like an unjuſt judge; which cannot but condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while he paſſeth ſentence upon others. But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If our active teſtimony by words and works be not received, then our paſſive teſtimony, in ſuffering for the Truth, muſt not be denied; for it is a Chriſtians duty, both to do (and if God call for it) to die
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154195:115"/> for the truth; yea, though the world ſhould condemn us of folly for becoming Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs to reſcue Truth from the ſnare of the wicked, and our cheerful conteſts for the ſame be laid upon us by wicked and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, as a mark of contradiction; yet let us not be diſcouraged therewith, as knowing, that thereby we do but fill up the ſufferings of our bleſſed Redeemer, who will have us to contend earneſtly for the faith, though it be ſometimes not without loſſe of goods, eſtate, yea and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of pain, impriſonment, loſſe of bloud, and that in great abundance, but alſo by death it ſelf. For it is a Tyrants way, to torture Chriſtians by cruel uſage, and at laſt deſtroy them: yea ſuch hath been the lot of Gods Saints in all ages, thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and deſtroyed; for the Prophet <hi>Elijahs</hi> muſt be in danger, the <hi>Ieremies</hi> in priſon, the Diſciples loſe their goods, and the holy Confeſſors pay their tribute of allegiance to Almighty God with pain, and the Martyrs with their lives; and though theſe afflictions may ſeem terrible to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſuffer for the Truth, yet the higheſt of them is no more than lawful, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary if called thereunto; for the pious hearts of true Chriſtians have alwayes thus teſtified to the Truth, witneſs Saint <hi>Paul, What mean you to weep and break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154195:116"/> to die at Ieruſalem, for the Name of the Lord Ieſus, Acts</hi> 21.13. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. He ſaith elſewhere, <hi>Neither do I account my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> It is remarkable to conſider the way which Almighty God took to ſupport his Diſciples and Servants, in deſpight of the wiſdom and malice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> for the planting of his Church in Chriſtianity, that it will appear almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to hear what were the afflictions of the Church, how intolerable her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that had they not had one to ſupport them who was Almighty and All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it had been impoſſible they ſhould have continued ſtedfaſt; but they had not only the inward ſupport of the Spirit to ſtrengthen, but the outward example of our Saviours Paſſion to incourage them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conformity to him, both in doing and ſuffering; and ſo nearly did the Saints copy out one anothers lives, that their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were ſeemingly converted into one anothers bodies, and one would have thought that the dying bloud of the one was infuſed into anothers veins; for no ſooner was one cut off by the hands of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, but God preſently inſpired another with faith and patience to witneſs to his Truth, and the torturing of the body made but the mouth ſpeak the louder in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing unto the Truth. So that by what
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154195:116"/> you have already heard you may ſee Chriſtian Profeſsion is no ſecure kind of living; for he that believes in Chriſt, muſt be no niggard of his life for the Truth, when God cals to bring him home by death. Indeed it is yet our happineſs, that in theſe cloudy dayes we are not brought to the fire and faggot for the tryal of our faith; God only knows when, and upon whom that heavy lot muſt fall, and in what manner it will come; this we are not able to demonſtrate, but by the luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of moſt mens zeal in the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it is to be feared, that when thoſe dayes do come, that many will turn from Chriſt rather than burn for the Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appears, that many untrained ſouls are ſo wedded to their luſts, that they had rather loſe their intereſt in Gods love, then forgoe one darling ſin: many do ſo love the works of vanity, that they have made ſhipwrack of faith, and turned their eares unto fables; and when you ſhall read, or hear of theſe, then may you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thoſe locuſts are come upon the earth, ſpoken of by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 9th of the <hi>Revelation</hi> 8, 9. verſes, which had power to <hi>torture men,</hi> and like <hi>Scorpions</hi> with their power able to ſting them to <hi>death;</hi> then beware, <hi>leſt you be led into the errors of the wicked,</hi> 2 St. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. but be you ſtabliſhed in the known, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154195:117"/> and eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England;</hi> which I dare be bold to ſay, for <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> is more <hi>purely true,</hi> and <hi>truly pure</hi> from <hi>errors,</hi> than any <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> whatſoever; and ſhall be ready to prove them ſo, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall call me thereunto; for the Truth of God will remain pure, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the malice of gain-ſayers, and therefore we ſhould defend it with all our might, for the Truth will ſpread it ſelf, though there be no other place but Pulpits to declare it in, nor no other witneſſing but by preaching, nor no witneſſes but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but yet many in their loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition have yet highly exalted God, by a faithful teſtimony to his Truth; and though this life be encombred by ſickneſs and infirmities, yet this readineſs to ſuffer ſhall be able to ſilence any gain-ſayer: when thou art not able to witneſs much, becauſe of thy weakneſs, yet do as much as thou canſt, do your beſt, and God will accept it, though mean, if from a willing mind; for it will be nothing to ſuffer by martyrdome, when we conſider it is for ſo great a prize, as is the Truth of God, and will be to our ſouls, if we continue ſtedfaſt therein: for ſtill, in every age, God will keep ſome defenders of the Truth; and why may not we be the perſons? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould God call us to it, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:154195:117"/> to ſuffer for the Truth, it would be but a juſt judgement for God to take his Goſpel from us, and give it to a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people; for ſo the Apoſtles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſerve the <hi>Iews, Acts</hi> 13.46. the Truth of God, in the Houſe of God had dwelt among us for many years together, in much ſerenity, till of late years it hath been toſſed upon the troubled waters; therefore let us in our words and works witneſs to it, leſt he take it from us alſo, and give it to others that will give it better entertainment than we have done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all of us make it our prayer unto Almighty God:</p>
            <p>Oh Lord, <hi>rather let our hearts witneſs to the Truth, that thy Truth may witneſs unto us; then by our not witneſſing for thee we come to be deſtroyed by thee: let thy Truth dwell with us here, that we may dwell with thee hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> let not your faith be ſhaken or moved by tribulations, or any kind of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings whatſoever, knowing this, that after you have fought a good fight, and kept the faith, <hi>there ſhall be laid up for you</hi> (and all other his faithful Servants) <hi>a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the righteous Iudge ſhall give you at that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.7, 8. and <hi>to this end were we born, and for this

            <p n="2">2.

It was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among the heathens, to derive their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154195:120"/> lawes from their Gods, giving them names accordingly: but we that are Chriſtians have our law from the true God, who is the author of truth; <hi>The law was given by Moſes, but Grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.17. where you ſee the truth of ſalvation is aſcribed to the Goſpel; and that which we are to conſider, the end of Chriſts coming into the world for, is, that it was not to give new lawes, but to fulfil the old law: for we find not the forme of the new Teſtament to carry in it the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a law, but onely the precepts thereof to be brought in occaſionally by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in a way of interpretation, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and alſo by application, but not in a way of conſtitution: therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>think not that I came to deſtroy the law and the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.17.18. It is not that I come to take away the law and the Prophets, but rather to fulfil them; this is that law which is the rule of mens actions, written

            </p>
            <p>It is to be underſtood of all the law, as it was given unto the Jews, and others, whether they were men juſt or unjuſt; but eſpecially unto the Jewes, in a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tranſlation then to other <hi>people:</hi> the law of works, it is true, was aboliſhed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours comming; but the law of doctrines,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154195:121"/> and rules of holy living, given by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God in the Mount, though theſe were in ſome ſenſe perfected by bringing in the ſubſtance, (for the ſhadowes flie away when the ſubſtance appears,) yet I ſay, this law is not diſanulled, but perfected in ſuch a manner, that it is now become the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of Chriſtian piety, whatever the <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay in oppoſition thereunto, as that it was nayled to the Croſs of Chriſt, and ſo aboliſhed by his death; but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the contrary, that ſtill the whole commanding power remains, becauſe the whole world ſhall be judged by the law, and word of truth, <hi>for every man ſhall be judged according to his works,</hi> Rev. 2.23. and we are to bear witneſs to this truth, by the teſtimony of our hands and tongues, our words and works: of our tongues, and that two wayes;</p>

Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. intimating, that there was a poſſibility for them to be led away with the <hi>error of the wicked,</hi> for what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> long ſince foretold, is in our dayes found too true, as <hi>there were falſe teachers among them, ſo there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us that ſhall deceive many, &amp;c.</hi> 2 St. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.12. though indeed he tells us, that they were the unlearned and the <hi>unſtable that wreſted the Scriptures to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ch.</hi> 16. yet he admoniſheth the faithful that they ſhould not be led away by the <hi>errors</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> 2 St. <hi>Peter</hi> 3.17, 18. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if <hi>he, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven, ſhould come and offer any other doctrine let him be accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1.8. which implyes that there would ſome come which would offer another doctrine, and that to the eminent Chriſtians of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia:</hi> and if it were poſſible <hi>the very elect ſhould be deceived,</hi> ſo ſaith our Saviour, Saint
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154195:122"/> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. therefore I ſay in a matter of ſo high concernment as divine truth is, we cannot do better then to confirme and bear witneſs to the truth, as by ſpeaking of it to the religious, ſo</p>
            <p>Secondly, by ſpeaking of it againſt the erroneous, paſſing the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon them that contradict the Scriptures, that by it we may confirme the truth to the faithful, by confutation of the oppoſite errors with the holy Scripture, which is the word of truth; and as it is the will of God, ſo the rule of righteouſneſs, and they that will rove from this rule of truth are erroneous, whether it be in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or converſation: for thoſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that are already gone aſtray, and by breaking Gods commands, teach others ſo to do, are chiefly erroneous, however they may think to pacifie the world, onely with a bare pretence to the truth, and call the wiſdome that is above, their father, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intending to deceive the ſimple with a ſhew of relation unto Almighty God, while indeed they are the ſervants of the Devil; for they know that if error ſhould come in its proper ſhape, it would be loathſome to every eye, but now that it comes in the name, and ſemblance of truth, they think none will refuſe it, for <hi>many,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many,</hi> Saint <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:154195:122"/> 24.5. ſo that you ſee truth is wounded by her own bow: and as <hi>Iacob</hi> got the bleſſing in the hairy garment of <hi>Eſau</hi> his <hi>elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> thereby deceiving his <hi>Father;</hi> ſo the wicked and erroneous men that are in the world, ſeek to deceive the <hi>Church</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, in the apparel of our elder brother <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> ſo the <hi>Devil,</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies, could come and tempt our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> with the words of holy Scripture, for when <hi>Chriſt</hi> alledged Scripture againſt him, he did the ſame to our bleſſed <hi>Redeemer;</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. no cunninger way for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to bring in others under the ſame condemation with themſelves, then by pretending truth and piety to be the ground of theit actions. The Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not think ſcorne to borrow the ſhape of an Angel of light, if he thinks it may prove to his advantage; and is it not a countenancing of blaſphemy for any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or people to give diſpenſation for all manner of heretical opinions, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon all occaſions to betray the truth, and the profeſſors thereof into a ſtate of ſin and miſery? Examine but <hi>Acts</hi> 18.19. and 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.20. therefore ſeeing the factors of Satan are ready to betray many ſouls to perdition, by corrupting Gods holy word, is it not time for us to ſnatch the ſword out of their hands, and beat them with the ſtrength and edge of thoſe ſpiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154195:123"/> which they endeavour to wound our heads withal: for the truth is not like wax, which is made to receive the image of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phanatical brain; no, where doubts ariſe in the holy Scripture, they muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by its own ſpirit, and not anothers. But as we muſt defend truth with our tongues, ſo</p>
            <p>Secondly, practically, by our words and works; when the doctrine of Chriſtianity is that way of truth which is evil ſpoken of, and when men in profeſſion are Chriſtians, but in converſation are Pagans, and Papiſts, &amp;c. <hi>Ro.</hi> 2.24. and St. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.7. and when that truth is diſgrac'd by the bad lives of men, their ſins become ours if we rebuke them not; therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. That tongue which rebukes not his brother when he ſees him go aſtray, draws all the guilt of the action upon himſelf, and ſo we make our ſelves ſharers with him in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for it is moſt certain, he gives conſent that holds his peace, and no way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the action, <hi>Num.</hi> 30.4. the father by his ſilence at the daughters vow is there made co-partner with her; and not onely the father, but the husband alſo, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon by their ſilence are ſaid to give conſent to the action, as appears at large in that chapter. Indeed there are two waies to keep a man from evil:
<list>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:154195:123"/>
                  <item>The one by reproof.</item>
                  <item>The other by not conſenting to the action when committed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the truth is, any Chriſtians conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or evil example, (but Maſters and Rulers eſpecially) do harden the ſinners heart, and make him think well or ill of himſelf, according as they approve or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the actions they ſee committed by him; the truth is, the Miniſters ſilence at the ſins which he ſees committed, often encourageth his people to go to hell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> complaint, <hi>The name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you, Rom.</hi> 2.24. and God himſelf hath commanded expreſly, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, Levit.</hi> 19.17. not to rebuke thy brother when he does amiſſe, is as much as to hate thy brother; therefore it is ſaid, cry aloud and ſpare not, <hi>tell Iudah of her ſins, and Iſrael of their tranſgreſſions;</hi> if we pleaſe men, we cannot ſpeak the truth, and we muſt ſpeak the truth, what man ſoever we diſpleaſe. Indeed there are three things eſpecially, which breed enmity in men againſt us for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth unto them:
<list>
                  <item>1. Diſpleaſure.</item>
                  <item>2. Diſprofit.</item>
                  <item>3. Diſcredit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Diſpleaſure; for hearing of the truth onely ſpoken many times galls
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154195:124"/> ſome: for let but truth be rightly ſpoken, or ſeeme in the application but to touch their iniquities, and they will preſently, like the frantick patient, flie in the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons face when he ſearches deep, though it be for their ſafety; ſo ſometimes the leaſt touch of truth will make men fret and fume, and vent their malice in furious words againſt them who do but diſcharge their duty, by a faithfull reproof of their ſinfull actions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be againſt their profit, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their trade, when application of truth is ſo made, they cannot endure ſuch doctrine, but preſently the Miniſter muſt ſuffer an ejection at leaſt for his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and this muſt be done too, with the greateſt pretence of Piety; for they think it no ſacriledge to take the houſes of God, and make them dens of Theeves; ſo that you may ſee, and cannot but finde, that many times the witneſſing of the truth againſt that where the gain of wicked men lies, breeds in them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, both againſt the truth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealers thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſcredit; rebuke the perſons that commit ſuch deeds as are offenſive to Almighty God, and preſently they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their reputation is vaniſhed; for they think truth no ſooner beholds, then accuſes their actions; and, which they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:154195:124"/> account worſt of all, it condemnes them, and their courſes; for truth hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of light, it will diſcover all the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our works, and therefore doe men hate the light of truth, <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil;</hi> for truth, in the whole tenor of it, cannot be otherwiſe then a revealer of evil; for though no man can hate the truth, as pleading for it ſelf in the generall; yet men doe envy it, when particularly it ſhines upon them, and lets them ſee themſelves; and becauſe men would have a full ſwindge in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, therefore doe they take offence at the truths of God, when manifeſt to their faces: but however it ſhould not diſcourage any, whether Miniſter, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the diſcharge of their duty, (if we doe it in the diſcharge of a good conſcience) becauſe the world frownes upon us for ſo doing; knowing this for a truth, that while we bear the ill will of men in witneſſing for the truth, yet we gain the good will of God. What though fleſh and blood ſhall ſay, favour thy ſelf, and comply with wicked men for thy ſafety? and bid thee change thy voice, as often as the men of the world their principles, and adviſe thee that this, or that thing is true, becauſe the great ones will have it ſo? doe not thou incline to any ſuch perſwaſions, for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:154195:125"/> ſaith, <hi>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, then a ſtalled Ox, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred therewith,</hi> Prov. 15.17. Which ſhewes that the enjoyment of Gods love, in the depth of miſery, is more to be priced, then the greateſt plenty, and the anger of God therewith. But fleſh and blood will perſwade to the contrary, as if truth had place, but not at all times: but our Saviour ſhewes it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for now being before <hi>Pilate,</hi> he carries the ſame face he had when he was in the Temple: Innocency is as meekly bold, and faithfully confident, when pleading at the barre, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Pulpit; nor is it leſſe aſhamed of truth, becauſe pleading before men, whoſe intentions are to condemne, not to applaud it for the ſame; our nakedneſſe and inability to ſecure us from their malice and cruelty, ſhould not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at all frighten us from our duty, in witneſſing to the truth, but rather incourage our whole man to be employed in ſo accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſervice; for we ſhould bear witneſſe to the truth in our underſtanding, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, practice, and in our good workes; for the teſtimony of the tongue, without the hand, is not ſufficient, profeſſion of good workes is the whole work of a Chriſtian; and walking contrary to the truth, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, or caſting a ſoul aſperſion on the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:154195:125"/> truth: we ſhould bear witneſſe to the truth both in words and workes; and it is certainly a great offence to be guilty of either, but moſt offence when found tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in both; yet of the two, it is the farre greater ſinne to deny God in workes, then in words; and that will appear, if you conſider theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Object, the greater it is that we ſinne againſt, the greater is the ſinne we commit; now to deny the truth, is to ſinne againſt God himſelfe, becauſe he is the Author of truth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to work wickedneſſe againſt God, muſt needs be moſt criminall, the ſinnes againſt the firſt Table being thoſe which eſpecially concern him; for which cauſe Divines conclude him the greater ſinner that is found guilty of the firſt, then he that offends againſt the ſecond Table onely; becauſe that by the one, he is but guilty of impiety againſt men, but in the other of wickedneſſe againſt God; the one being of defect, the other of exceſſe: ſo that the Object, which is offended in the firſt Table, being the greater, muſt needs make the ſinne to be the more grievous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the greater evidence; he that denies the truth with his lips, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did, he evidently injures God and Chriſt; but he that by a wicked life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the truth, and the God of truth, not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154195:126"/> onely injures their natures himſelf, but incourageth others alſo to doe the ſame, by giving them an example of wickedneſs: the difference, as to men, is onely this; the one ſeemes openly to deny him in words, the other with his works; the one ſpeaks, and the other doth, evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſinne is greater in regard of puniſhment inflicted; for a farre greater puniſhment is impoſed upon the ſwearer and blaſphemer, under the Law, then upon him that offended man onely; the denyall of God in the old Law, was to ſuffer no other puniſhment then ſtoning to death; and the civill Law amongſt us doth command, that offenders in this kinde ſhould have their tongues cut out, or bored thorow; which, it ſeemes, was thought too gentle a puniſhment among the people of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> And if evil tongues deſerve this heavy doom, what think you, is the juſt deſert of wicked hands, and evil works? ſo that ſtill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a truth, that he that denies God and his truth by a wicked life, is a farre greater ſinner then he that doth it onely with his lips: which will more fully appear, if you conſider but theſe four grounds of ſinne in their ſeverall cauſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
<list>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:154195:126"/>
                  <item>1. Conſider the moving cauſe.</item>
                  <item>2. The voluntarineſſe.</item>
                  <item>3. The perfection.</item>
                  <item>4. The full ſignification of ſin.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From the moving cauſe of ſinne; the more forcible it is, the more grievous it will be to us after the commiſſion thereof; for the ſeeming pleaſures which move men to wicked lives, end in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then reall diſquiet; and let the moving cauſe of open denying the truth be what it will, yet this is certain, the leſſe forcible it is from any extrinſecal cauſe, the more guilt we contract by doing of it: as for example, the fear of death may ſometimes make a man to deny the truth with his lips, which in many reſpects will receive a more favourable conſtruction, then if with violence we ſhould turn from profeſſors in ſhew, to reall perſecutors of the truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the voluntarineſs thereof; where there is no conſent of the Will the ſin is little, but where there is full conſent of the will, there is very much of ſin, and ſin is therefore ſin, becauſe voluntary; therefore he who denies the Truth only with his lips for fear of death, doth ſin leſſe than he who with a wicked life ſins with a full liberty of the will, by a free conſent, and unconſtrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154195:127"/> by either tyranny or ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the perfection of all the parts of a man, united in full ſtrength to reſiſt and perſecute the Truth; which very much differs from compulſion, becauſe in the one there is a full conſent of perfect parts, and in the other there is but a lame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent yeilded by conſtraint; for he that by a Tyrant is compelled with force of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to deny the Truth, doth in a ſort deny and not deny, he denies it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with his lips, but his heart greives inwardly for the ſame, becauſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bears witneſs to the Truth; but he that with a wicked life is given wholly to ſin, that he hath all his delights in it, that man hath made himſelf perfect in evil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the more full ſignification, we do ſignifie more of wickedneſs to be in us by our works than by our words; he ſits at a farre greater denial of truth, that denies it by a wicked life, than he that denies it onely with his lips for fear of death; though both theſe are great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, ſince in our lives, words, and works we are to bear witneſs to the Truth; for <hi>to this end were we born, and for this cauſe came we into the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Our Saviour bids, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> &amp;c. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.6. then we may hence learn, that thoſe that ſhould light others to Heaven by their Doctrine, muſt not darken their way by the evil example of an unholy life; and not only muſt Miniſters, but people alſo, let the light of holineſs appear viſible in their lives: When God places a man (a private Chriſtian) in the lower Orbe, he puts him there to ſhine like a ſtarre, bright and clear in his own ſphere; Chriſtians ſhould ſhine and bear witneſs in their lives, and be cautious how they walk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every ſin puts a dimneſs upon the ſoul, and darkneſs internal can expect no other but to go to darkneſs eternal; and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>that our good works ſhould make thoſe that look on us as evil doers glorifie God in the day of viſitation,</hi> 1 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 2.12. There be ſome that muſt believe in Chriſt throughout the world, and witneſs his Truth to unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by a holy life; and why may it not belong to us? but if on the contrary we be found to live as they live, how ſhall they be brought to believe as we believe? It was the ſaying of a Heathen, <hi>If I did ſee the Chriſtians lives better, I ſhould think

               <p>Oh therefore, that by holy lives, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reading, faithful hearing and conſtant ſtudying and meditating in the wayes of God, and the Truths of God, we would make our ſelves able and ready to give an account of the hope that is in us; that ſo both in our knowledge and practice, we bearing witneſs to the Truth here on earth, we may have the truth in our conſciences, to bear witneſs to our ſelves, that we are the Sons of God; that ſo he that aſcended into Heaven to take poſſeſsion of his own Glory, may in time bring us thither, who himſelf affirmed, and after whoſe example we ſhould walk, that as <hi>he was born, and came into the world to bear witneſs to the truth,</hi> ſo we ſhould alſo account of our ſelves, that <hi>we were born, and that we came into the world, that we might bear witneſs to the truth:</hi> that we came into the world, this Chriſtian world, to witneſs to the truth
